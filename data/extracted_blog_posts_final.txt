I will share my experiences of living, traveling, eating in different parts of japan; write my opinions,views about Japanese cultures like their honesty, strict time keeping tradition; provide interesting information about traveling, japanese food and many other things in my blog. Years have passed since I first stepped into this island of Pacific Ocean. So many things I have heard, read throughout my childhood about manga, anime, cute dolls, eating raw fish, samurai swords etc. Japan in my imagination was different than japan from my first hand experience as it always happens. Of course it turned out to be much better, much exciting.. And here I am to explain all of that from Tokyo to Kagawa to Osaka to where not ...

It has been two years since I came to Osaka. Now it's time to leave this beautiful place. My experience at Osaka University was really a nice one. Osaka University has 3 campuses, the biggest one is the Suita campus, then the Toyonaka campus and lastly the smallest Minoh campus. I had little experience staying at Suita campus. Because my department was in Toyonaka campus. I should say that I was really lucky to be a part of Department of Information and Computer sciences. My department provides three courses- "Computer Science", "Software Science" and "Mathematical Science" course.  I majored in "Mathematical Science" here. As I entered into my department as a transfer student directly into the 3rd year in my course, I was very busy during my first year. I had to take classes with not only the 3rd year students, but also with 2nd year students.

Title: Change - My new job life

This year I have gone through the biggest transformation of my life. My student life has come to an end and my job life has started. I am now a software engineer at GREE, Inc. at Tokyo. But currently I am not residing at Tokyo. Instead I have decided to commute from Tsukuba, Ibaraki to my workplace at Roppongi, Tokyo using Tsukuba Express. Now every working day, I need to wake up at around 7:00 am. I rush to take the Express train from Tsukuba station. Then after about 45 minutes, I have to change train once at Kitasenju station. And I reach to my workplace at Roppongi around 9:15. Tsukuba Express is really a nice ride for me. Japanese train systems sometimes really amaze me. Urban Japanese life heavily depend on their rapid transit train systems, otherwise called metro systems. Trains rarely make huge delays and provide the fastest and probably the best transportation system here. But even though it feels not enough during the morning on working days, when most of the people use trains. In the morning, train compartments get fully packed by suited booted office workers, sometimes leaving no room to even stand. From Tsukuba, because of being the first station of the Tsukuba Express, I can easily seat and comfortably reach to Kitasenju. The train runs through the vast green fields. And the morning sun and the shiny outside view really thrills me. The more the train reaches near Tokyo,the more the outside views change.  Kitasenju station takes a huge load of office going people. Trains frequently come and leave. I can never take a seat inside the train there and have to stand for few stations before getting a lucky one. I pass my whole day at office and it's evening when I reach back home at Tsukuba. I will write about my office life in later posts.

Title: Few days have passed @ GREE

I have passed 17 days at GREE. In total 71 new people joined GREE. Out of them, there are people from 3 categories: Engineer, PM(Product Manager), Business. I am one of the new 20 engineers. Last few days, we had training on business manners and business skills. Business manner training was at the same time interesting and somewhat boring. It was interesting because there were new things, but boring because of so many rules. But was informative and probably very necessary for a Japanese business career. Japanese business people really follow a lot of manners. They have special complex words for almost every business situation and are expected to use complex grammatical structures in business conversations. You are just not allowed to use the regular Japanese words in a business meeting. We were divided into small teams and practiced different manner rules. I remember specially the method of exchanging business cards. It was not like just handing over a card to a business person. You have to maintain your footsteps, raise your hands up to a measured height close to your breast and slowly offer your card and at the same time take card from the person. Then we had 6 day business skill training. It was an interesting experience. We have been taught how to logically think.

Title: Another Golden Week

Every year in Japan, we get some vacation days in the last week of April and the first week of May. These days are collectively called "Golden Week". I passed five out of seven Golden Weeks throughout my six and a quarter years of Japanese life in Tokyo. My girlfriend's birthday is on the 5th May and interestingly that day has always been included in all the Golden Weeks. She had lived in Tokyo till 2012 where as I lived in Kagawa. In the April of 2012, I moved to Osaka, the centre of Kansai Japan and  she moved to Tsukuba which is quite close to Tokyo. Because we always wanted to pass together on her birthday, I had to come to Tokyo on Golden Weeks. Only in 2011, we were not together because I was extremely busy then at my dormitory at my College of Technology in Kagawa. And in the golden week of 2012, she visited my place at Osaka. This year, we also had a wonderful Golden Week in Tsukuba. In fact, we passed very nice days in quite unplanned ways. I kind of thought I would be busy with programming and studying for my current office projects. But it didn't happen that way. Unexpectedly, some of my very close seniors decided to come to Tsukuba from Ogaki of Gifu prefecture. We went to eat in an Indian restaurant close to Tsukuba University. Everyone loved the food- Nan, Kababs, "Kadai Mutton" curry, "Dal Tarka" etc. Normally the curries at Indian restaurants here in Japan are not very liked by us because all different curries taste quite same. But this time it was really good and everyone appreciated the lunch. And we had comfortable conversations that we call "Adda" in our mother tongue Bengali. It's quite rare to have a gathering like this as we live in different places and are busy in universities and offices most of the time. Not only me but also three of my seniors started their job life recently. So part of our conversation was about our experiences of Japanese job culture. After the lunch, we decided to go to see "Kasumigaura Lake" which is only 30 minutes away by car from Tsukuba centre. I drove the car our seniors brought from Ogaki and I loved it. Unfortunately I had mistaken the road (actually the car navigator didn't work well as we didn't input the destination properly). We went to a different place first, though quite near to the lake. Then we had to change our root and at last succeeded to reach there. The place was absolutely beautiful. Kasumigaura lake is the second largest lake of Japan. There's also a magnificent garden, full of flowers, by the lake. We walked on the roads by the lake. [caption id="attachment_110" align="alignnone" width="1024"] Wind mill at Kasumigaura (source: http://www.panoramio.com/photo/15556825)[/caption] We also saw the wind mill. There is a staircase to walk up from where the whole garden can be seen. We all walked up there and really enjoyed the view from there. It was a cloudy and windy day and we wished we could come on a sunny day and enjoy the sun set. After about two hours of walking and talking, we got back to our car and came back to Tsukuba. Then we passed friendly time at the central Tsukuba University campus. Some other friends, juniors joined our team. One of the juniors are very good at cooking and cooked delicious sweets for us. We sat by a small beautiful pond. We were talking different things, laughing loudly and enjoying the wind. Then the time came for my seniors to go back to Ogaki. We drove together up to Tsukuba centre again and then they left. The next days were also good. I slept, watched movies. And then the golden week ended and I had to start my normal days again. Now I am feeling quite energetic and trying to concentrate to my work.

Sometimes in the morning, when I get out of the room and see the beautiful sun shining brightly outside, I just start smiling. I feel like being tuned with a new day with vigor and energy. I try to feel the gentle breeze blowing around me and make myself free from any agitation or disturbance I had from past days to achieve a calm state of my mind. I walk with slow steps, look around and give attention to the details. The place I'm currently living in is close to Tsukuba centre and Tsukuba station. There is a beautiful garden called "Chuou garden (中央公園)". It has lovely wide pathways to walk. Inside the garden, there is a large pond in one side. There is an exhibition hall placed interestingly right in the middle of the pond. A cross walk has connected the hall to the main garden pathway. Tsukuba expo centre is situated in the opposite side containing a great planetarium and exhibition hall. In vacation days, parents bring their children to show science exhibitions and star shows arranged in the planetarium. Last year I also went to see a show there. In their shows, they not only show the awesome stars and their locations, but also associate different stories of mythical characters to make them interesting. So many trees, so many birds all seem to be trying to befriend me and suddenly I realize that I have so many companions with me. [caption id="attachment_120" align="aligncenter" width="497"] Pathway by the pond.[/caption] [caption id="attachment_122" align="aligncenter" width="500"] You can see the pond of the Tsukuba Chuo garden. In the left, the dome like structure is the Plentarium inside Tsukuba Expo centre and in the right side there is a H2 rocket standing up. And in the left hand side  So many trees, so many flowers, so many birds all seem to be trying to entice and befriend me. For a while, I don't feel lonely and suddenly recognize every living beings surrounding me  as my companion. My sharp senses bring me tremendous joy and appreciation for the world I am living in. Gradually my step gets bigger. I pass the garden[/caption] [caption id="attachment_123" align="aligncenter" width="875"] Inside the garden, there are some monuments like this.

Today i have stopped by a restaurant inside Kitasenju station. I was feeling extremely hungry after a long hectic day. So I decided to take a food set. In a Japanese food shop, a set typically means a drink, a main dish and some side menus. My set was named "Chenghis khan". YEAH.. It was named after the Mongolian warrior Chenghish Khan. I was served Ramen- Japanese noodles and cooked sliced beef. I am not sure whether the beef was imported from Mongolia and that is why the food set is named like that but definitely I was surprised and excited to find out the taste. It was good. I was full and happy when I quickly finished all of them. I also took "Karage" - which is a kind of chicken fry. [caption id="attachment_129" align="aligncenter" width="320"] The ramen shop where I took my dinner.[/caption] I am currently working on an iOS application. I am trying to create a productivity app which will allow you to take video while you are producing something like writing, drawing painting, taking notes, pointing ideas. It will be something like a combination of two iOS apps "Paper" and "Notability" . I also was trying to have a grasp of roll playing games like final fantasy. I was watching a number of youtube videos and quite amazed by the detailed 3D character and background designs in square enix games. Here is a  video that I have checked. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14tPjDYUrUc

This week, I am very busy. My current project at my office hasn't been progressed as expected. I am learning new things every day and the learning curve was steeper than I imagined. I am making a productivity app for iOS platform. The whole project has been divided into several steps or phases. I have worked each phase separately and then integrated them together. But each phase needs to be developed more now. But any new function that I want to add costs me a good amount of time. So the progress is comparatively slower. Only 4 days are left and there are many other things to do along with this specific project. I am also in the process of applying to the TOEFL Japan scholarship. Right at this moment, this application should be given the highest priority as the deadline is 28th May. But the application requires three 150 word essays, one 75 word essay and one 600 word essay. That is a huge work !!! So, I am in great pressure. Moreover, I will have to perform a presentation on web security on wednesday. Oh!!! I will have to strictly maintain my time this week to finish all these timely as well as properly. The problem is I feel bad when things turn out to be imperfect. But under such pressure, nowhere you can give total concentration and as a result you are going to get poor quality of work. But that's not what I want. So, I need to work my ass off...

Title: If you had the authority to change education in your community or country, in a positive  way, what specific changes would you make?
Published Date: Thu, 29 May 2014 03:48:52 +0000
Categories & Tags: Home
Content:
I am very dissatisfied with the education system in today’s society in general, specially of my country Bangladesh. Our education system has turned into an evil system that enslaves students and continuously diminish their thinking ability. While education has the most divine purpose of freeing mind, the current system running is acting like a messy machine which completely does the opposite. In Bangladesh, our education system has been suffering a lot due to the lack of rethinking and restructuring and failed to give birth of educated generations who can change in our crime-ridden society. Students are not taught to cooperate with each other but rather encouraged to learn selfishness and self-centredness. Interaction between students are very low as the curriculums are designed to force students only to memorise facts and figures without proper understanding. So much emphasis is placed on memorization as opposed to creativity that students waste most of their energy and time in taking exam centric preparations instead of enjoying learning. They fail to find the relevance and connection between what they learn inside the class and what they see in the outside world. But to let them grow as a person with passion, know how, creativity, resilience and someone who know when to listen and when to lead, I think we need a system that excites, stimulates and encourages learning by doing real things, integrating theory with practice. Study environment needs to be transformed so that students become able to work as a group, think as a group and can develop their problem solving skills through discussion and exchange of ideas. In the current system, students' main focus is to gain high grades in the exams, compete for top rated limited job positions and brag about their spurious achievements. It is very important to destroy the misguided belief that one form of intelligence, one particular field or job position is in some way better than another. We should at first reconstruct the evaluation and assessment systems to reshape such behaviours. Currently held exams are utterly inefficacious as students are offered narrow syllabus, lists and suggestions. Exams are also a source of great mental stress for the students because of social mindsets. Teachers unfortunately have to spend most of their time assessing learning instead of assisting learning. If I have the authority I will change the exam format and create a decentralised evaluation system where students will be scored for performance of overall academic year.  A student should be judged by his behaviour, performance in extra curricular activities, class attendance and class performance. Emphasis should be given in the guiding procedures to help students make moral and ethical choices in their learning and living. That is why we also need to increase teachers' salary and develop appropriate training programs to help foster the development of teachers with integrity and sound character. We should be aware that our education system is largely structured on factory manufacturing model where children moves through learning conveyor belts, then sorted and labelled. Our recent knowledge about the diversity of minds and all the different ways of learning continuously tell us that such a rigid system will not work. Research has shown that the readiness of a person doesn’t actually depend on their age. I want to play a major part in bringing mass customization in teaching and learning(e.g. start ages, starting sexes, graduation requirements, interactive teaching methods) which will allow young students develop their particular talents and aspirations. I believe there is no simple general solution to the multifarious complex problems in the education system but a rapid change is still an emergency. Further Reading: 1.

Title: Why did I choose to study in United States and my future plan?
Published Date: Thu, 29 May 2014 04:12:17 +0000
Categories & Tags: Home
Content:
Please briefly explain why you have decided to study in United States?  My future goal is to become a researcher. United states is a country where most prominent scientists and technologists work together to discover new things, to solve the most difficult problems for humanity. Academic environments in an american university is uniquely designed to inspire young scientists to devote themselves to bring cutting edge scientific breakthroughs. As a graduate student, it is possible to create great academic connections to faculty members, institutions and organisations, participate in conferences to accumulate knowledge from different fields of studies to enrich my own research. Technology has greatly changed our lives and most of the experiments for any new technology are primarily done in united states. An opportunity to study at united states means to me an abundant scope of knowing world renowned professors, their labs and their works, working at very important projects in both universities and industry research facilities.  Based on your current achievements and interests, describe the kind of work that you plan to be doing in 5 years, both in your career and in your community.  As a computer science PhD student at Purdue University CS department, I believe most of my activities in the coming years will relate to academic research, teaching, academic content creation etc. My research interest lies in statistical data analysis and computational process of pattern discovery in large scale data. I want to develop myself as a data scientist who can apply his skills to solve social problems of today's interconnected world. I will contribute to the improvement of tools for community data mining and social network data analysis which will help sift, collate and combine pieces of information from mundane activities to improve human life. I have always put a great effort in tutoring disadvantaged kids through online education and I hope to develop much more advanced system using data driven designs. I will continue to be an activist who fight for the freedom of sharing knowledge, expanding human connections to make this world a better place.

Title: To Nagoya

I just made it. Just got inside the bus that I was about to miss. I will again have to praise the Japanese transportation system. Their trains are undoubtedly awesome. Today I am going to Nagoya. My very dearest brother is moving to Malaysia for several months for some job experience from Oogaki, Gifu and I decided to take his car for the next two months and then the car will be taken by another senior of mine. So I planned last week that I will go to Nagoya by bus, then to Oogaki by train. I woke up very early today. Yesterday I came late from office. I was totally exhausted and can't even remember when I slept wearing almost nothing. When I woke up I found out that the light wasn't even switched off. So I took a bath in that very early morning. Then I started reading some articles, blogs. I was reading about Stephen Wolfram. All his contribution to mathematical and scientific research and his innovations totally boggled my mind. I wish I could be someone like him someday. Time passed first. It was 9:00 when I felt aware that I need to prepare myself for my journey to Nagoya. I made my breakfast- tortilla, egg and chicken burger. I called my mom in Bangladesh and started talking over skype. We were talking about some of my future plans. And I became unaware about the clock ticking fast. The clock got back my attention around 10:30. And I was already late then. I should have taken the 10:27 train to reach Hamamatsuchou station to get into my bus which  is going to start at 12:00pm from the bus trminal in front of the World Trade centre. However I managed to take the 10:45 train. It reached Akihabara at around 10:40. sprang out to the platform and ran to take the JR Yamanote line. I was able to take a train that I would have missed if I walked normally. I calked to the emergency centre of the bus company to let them know my delay. They advised me to rush. I reached at Hamamatsuchou at 11:55  and I had only 5 minutes left. This was my first time at Hamamatsuchou station. But I was lucky that the bus terminal there is very close to the station. And I successfully dashed into the bus. I am sweating now,ctrying to calm down. Hope I wlll reach in time.

I realized that it's not always possible to follow a single plan in my life. Plans change depending on things, situations and people. Some plans even contradict with each other and create a lot of confusions. My confusion between staying in Tokyo and leaving it is getting worse day by day. Though I thought I came to the conclusion of leaving Tokyo for my higher education, a new opportunity has again made me swing to the opposite direction. Now I am being tempted again to keep continuing my life here. But again there are things to compromise. I know it's impossible to achieve everything at once in life. But some sacrifice are huge. I am still young and it's time to learn by challenging myself in various ways. So, I need to be strong and take each of my decision logically.Another great matter of regret is that I have gained a lot of weight again even after taking so much precautions. My eating habit has become really bad and sleep deprivation because of my hectic weekdays is the main culprit. I will have to change my life style again to get in shape. Disappointment never leaves me.

Title: New waves in my life

Content:
I had the opportunity to take part in a conversation ("Ghorowa Adda") in Tsukuba a few weeks before where I have been asked that question again, "What do you want to do with your life?" My answer was "I want to do something that will create some impact." I think the questioner found my answer too much generic and wanted something more specific. Then he asked "What sort of impact do you want to create?" I thought for a while and said, "If I get the opportunity to write, I will write books or articles that will inspire people, drive people to bring change. If I have any chance to build some system, I will try to find out the most necessary service needed for the people around. " Later I thought more about my scopes where I may have some roles. I believe I should not be in an environment that can destroy my creativity, my desire to do something new, my enthusiasm to cooperate in meaningful projects. I won't flourish in a condition where money is the one and only drive. I would love to be in an environment where I will constantly learn and will be intellectually stimulated and challenged. After finishing a diploma course on Information Engineering and then my undergraduate course on mathematical science, I had joined a Japanese company which recently earned some fame and money both locally and globally by creating new markets of social games. I had been learning every single day there with same aged Japanese programmers: new snippets of codes, new programming ideas, business strategies, program and event planning. Even there are lots of initiatives inside the company to encourage young employees to think about new game as well as non-game ideas so that new business can be run. Actually they have launched five new but not so awesome non-game projects this year. They are also putting some effort on social welfare. The engineering culture is undoubtedly very great there and taught me discipline and structured logical thinking. But after two months, unfortunately I have been assigned to a rather boring old project. And to get to a position where I can implement my own ideas will take an uncertain amount of time which is scary for me. I started feeling that this is not the sort of job that I wished to take as my career. I was rather fortunate. A great opportunity outside Japan came to my hand. I got selected as a Graduate student at "Purdue University" computer science department. When I applied to their PhD course last year, I wasn't really that sure whether I will be selected or not or whether I will be properly funded. Back in Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, I had deep interest in distributed computing. I have been working on a new virtual currency called "Bitcoin" which depends on distributed network. I also believe machine learning where we supervise machines, i.g. computers to learn to help us take better decisions or predict the future has vast influence on different fields from business to neuroscience. During my university programming life and even now, I also felt that I need to improve algorithmic and mathematical expertise. All these indicated me that Purdue University will be the perfect playing ground for me rather than working in a narrow corner here in a Japanese company. Moreover, I always felt that I am privileged as a Bangladeshi citizen and really hold a deep motivation to contribute to my country, country people and my language Bengali. That led me to work with the well known Shikkok.com and some personal educational projects that may help educate people back in my homeland. Recently I also talked with some of my high school Notredame and Bangladeshi university BUET friends about whether we may launch global open source software projects focussing on online development of necessary services and system automation. In my more than 6 years of Japanese stay with so many wonderful and magnificent experiences, the only great thing that I have missed is some good collaboration with some of my great friends in Bangladesh. And also during this four months of my first company job life, I found it extremely hard to work on such voluntary outside works and keep my life diverse. Lots of my friends are active in USA now whom I want to work with, play with and be crazy with. I also talked with my seniors here in Japanese university, seniors in American university and also in industry. All advised me to follow a path that can develop my potential. I was advised to analyse and challenge myself with pointed questions about what matters most in my life. So, it now became evident for me to leave Japan and start a new experience in Indiana and Illinois at USA where Purdue resides. Though leaving a very good job and getting into a long-term PhD course have its high opportunity cost, I think I should not be demotivated. I know I may fail or may not enjoy a research life or may be frustrated in university bureaucracy but still there are lots of brighter sides that no one knows. So... A new chapter is going to begin. I am moving to the land of dreams from this big crowded Tokyo where I will meet people from almost all over the world. And they will be the type of people who will hopefully welcome me. I am also lucky that my life partner Brishti is also moving with me and she is joining the master's program at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at University of Illinois. I have so many friends, seniors, juniors who assisted me, inspired me in my life. I want apology from people I may have unintentionally hurt or annoyed. Please wish me.

My time to join Purdue is getting nearer. On 28th evening, I reached my sweet home at Dhaka in Bangladesh. The journey was great. I took plane journeys after a long time, almost about 3 years. What an awesome experience to enjoy being in a plane flying above the white clouds! I saw the civilizations outside the small plane window with great surprise. How amazing human achievements are. I also enjoyed the magnificent sunset and my mind was full of joy. At home, my parents was waiting with love. My sweet younger brother is always with me now asking so many questions and I am so happy with my family. My elder sister was in her in law's house and will soon join us. All my relatives are coming to our house to meet me. Though it's tiresome, I am feeling great.However, I need to get back to work soon. I have been reading an open letter of the president of Purdue University and became totally amazed. How critical, how visionary and how extraordinary thinking they have! If a smaller portion of such dedication would exist in my beautiful country Bangladesh, we would have seen tremendous outcomes. Alas!!Quoting the sentences that struck me from each paragraph:THE PAJAMAS TEST "Why, in ten or fifteen years, will students still find it wise to pay lots of money to go and live somewhere for four or more years, when a host of competitors are offering to bring them excellent teachers and instruction in the inexpensive comfort of their own homes?"AFFORDABILITY "We stated that henceforth we would seek to adjust our spending to the budgets of students' families rather than require that they adjust their budgets to ours."ACCOUNTABILITY "But with a majority of recent graduates either unemployed or working at jobs that do not require a college degree, and with an estimated 45 percent of them living with parents rather than independently, these assumptions are being rethought."INNOVATION "Why can't at least some degrees be completed in less than the traditional four years, and why can't students move ahead as soon as they have demonstrated their mastery, or "competency" of a subject, rather than wait for an arbitrary testing date?"The full article: http://www.purdue.edu/president/email/2014/140113OpenLetterJan2014.pdf

Emotional wellbeing is very important in life. I was lost. I am still lost. It's hard to get back yourself when you are lost. Your dream breaks up. Your habits get destroyed. You see things fall apart in the blink of your eye. Everything goes wrong. Mistakes after mistakes pile up everyday. You're confused. But you don't loose hope. You don't stop trying. Optimism is the only thing that can bring your courage back. Happiness is something that's hard to earn. Need to love life again.

Title: My First Thanksgiving

This is my first thanksgiving at United States. Mark took me to a thanksgiving dinner in Indianapolis. I was lucky to have connected with Mark and his family. Mark lives in Lafayette with his younger daughter Becky. When I came to Purdue, I got to know him through Purdue IFP(International Friendship Program). Mark was very cordial and truly treated me as one of his family members since we met. Bobby and Abby are Mark's other son and daughter. I also happened to meet them last month when they came to Lafayette from east coast for their family celebration. Mark invited me and my girlfriend to attend the thanksgiving dinner at his brother-in-law's house at Indianapolis. There was a big Turkey there for us. We met a lot of new people that evening. All of them were very friendly and we enjoyed talking with each other, laughing and sharing our past experiences. There were various deserts like apple pie, pumpkin pie etc. that we enjoyed. I also had a lot of shrimp after a long time. Becky stayed at Indianapolis that night and Mark brought us back to Lafayette. This was the first time Brishti came to Lafayette. I was excited to show her a lot of things. But it was so windy and cold that she was much eager to stay inside. Moreover, she was really very tired. But again we left my place to meet some of our friends at Purdue village. They were our old Bangladeshi University friends. Brishti was so happy to meet her childhood friend who came from Stanford. She decided to stay at Purdue Village and I was quite disappointed with her decision. So, thanksgiving night didn't end well for me though it started really well. I forgot to mention..We actually drove from Champaign to Mark's place during the noon from where we started our journey to Indianapolis. In the morning, Brishti baked muffins and brownies for the families in Indianapolis and our friends in Purdue Village. Everyone loved them. Next day we went to a mall and did some shopping. There were black friday sales and we were able to buy some good staffs with affordable price. Then in the afternoon, we met several other friends at Purdue Village. One of our friends just became a proud mom of her newborn son. Brishti always loves babies and we stayed at their place for a while. We were hungry in the evening as we didn't take any lunch except some snacks. I took Brishti to Nine Irish Brothers though initially we went to Heisei- a Japanese restaurant. But Heisei was closed. Brishti liked their food. I also loved the Pots of Gold, one special shrimp food. Then we got back to Champaign. The moment we reached our parking lot, she suddenly kissed me. It was a moment of joy. Happy thanksgiving.

Title: Failure has become my companion

Failure and procrastination have become my life long companion now. Since last two years, I have been failing in almost everything I am aiming at. Sometimes I am aiming too high. Sometimes actually not so high. One common thing that I always do is to cram my mind with lots of things. When I am lazy, I don't do anything, I don't feel to do anything. But when I am active I feel to do a lot of things. I make too many plans, make too many tasks for a single day that I burn out. I schedule lots of activities and in the long run half of them are unfinished leaving me with a dissatisfactory feelings. Neither doing nothing nor trying to do a bunch in a whole is good. Even knowing that truth is not preventing me circling the same cycles again and again. I think I know what are the strategies which can help you reach your goal. But the most important things I am lacking is persistence and stubbornness to follow my own track.Sometimes changes are good. But my habit of being influenced and diverted is not helping me get the satisfaction of closure. Everything I start, I end up imperfectly. And sometimes my desire for too much perfectionism might have also hindered my desire to finish. Was I always the same procrastinator I am right now? My memories tell I wasn't always like this. My bad habits might have had bad effect on me. But sometimes it's not even the bad habits. Sometimes I make myself fall in so much trouble and bring harm for my body and mind. But I could have just avoided just making a little bit of change in my attitude. But those little changes seem to never happen last years. Every time I thought to restart it with vigour, I failed awfully. There were some events in previous months  which were out of my hands. I had misunderstanding with my most loved one. That almost shut down my mind for few weeks. I had to try hard so much just to get back a static condition. Probably those events also made me very week, protective. I always hated doing the same mistakes again and again. But alas! I never stopped being a fool. But again there are events happening now, distracting me, making me unhappy. Life won't always be as we wish it to be. I know that ugly truth. But we feel good in life when we have accomplishments. Now a days I am feeling so much void due to the lack of any accomplishments at all. I wish to change it all. I think I can and I will.

Title: The Empowering Thoughts

Categories & Tags: Home
Content:
Recently I read one of my friends' notes. Those were really empowering thoughts, gave me a lot of optimism. Feeling to share it here. The Empowering Thoughts: 1. Live in the moment. Be in the mindset that what you are doing right now is the most important task in the world. 2. Get your things done. When you finish things, you maximize your happiness intake. 3. Prioritize. Prioritizing your tasks to most important to least important relieves your anxiety. 4. Be in good health. Nothing beats a healthy body. You really have to try hard to be unhappy when you are healthy and operate in an able  body. 5. Invest in relationships with family, friends, and close ones. Do something for them. 6. In addition to 5,create values to others lives. 7. The universe has some ways to answer your call. 8. Take care of your parents before they die. Think how you want your kids to respect and care for you. 9. Forgive yourself. Don't judge yourself. Believe that you are precious. 10. If you are depressed, do a good deed immediately, even a smile. Do your laundry. Organize your desk. Call your mom. Call your best friend. Take a nap. 11. Listen to other peoples' stories. You'd probably feel that you are not alone or others are in worse conditions than yours. 12. Let go. Get rid of things that bother you. Throw away laundry stuff that you don't need. Cut down a phony friendship. Just don't invest in things that bother you. 13. Do yourself a big justice. You are here for a purpose. Find it. Contribute. As much cliched as it sounds, make this world a better place than you have found it. There are too much negativity, despair, melancholy, and paranoia. You don't need to be a part of it. 14. Believe that you deserve to be happy. One way to make you into believing so is to tweak your thinking by following ways: a. The things you don't get, don't want them any longer. Find flaws without demeaning. Just accept that you don't need the person of the thing. You are not a good match. b. Aim for things that are better. The better things, upon achieving, will help you forget the things you wanted once. 15. It's someone else's miss or loss if they don't understand you when you act with your best intention. Don't sweat over it. 16. Don't try too hard to win an argument if doing so can you lose you the person. The relationships are more important than winning the arguments. 17. Read and Run. One is for mind and another is for body.

Title: Don't undermine those unimportant stuffs.

Some Incoherent thoughts: There is sometimes huge difference between planning and implementing. The moment an idea sparked into your mind is far far away from that amazing moment of accomplishing or finishing the product out of your cute idea. My personal experience of jumping into the water just with my electric idea  didn't bring me light most of the times. I don't necessarily regret about all my excitements with my ideas. Because I believe ideas are the only tools that can help me refresh my dreams, realize what I am passionate about.  I just want to understand or probably just analyze the different ways my mind gets hyped and lose the very attraction it initially had after some major bumps. Definitely sometimes it's not worthy of investing time and energy on to something that probably lost its value or probably got started on false assumptions or misjudgments. But as nobody has infinite amount of time and has the luxury of failing in every attempt, we need to try to minimize our frustrations. Some questions: How we undermine the amount of preprocessing tasks underlying the final goal? How we burn out after wasted efforts? But of course there is necessity of putting our efforts into tasks which are not directly related. It may be called "expanding the horizon" stage. How motivation may fade out very quickly? Why? Because you value it differently now!! How we forget that other plans, programs, tasks, external affairs may affect our thought process and speed? So, always have plenty of measures against such distractions. What are the proper way of building strategies? This is hard problem. How tremendously unsuccessful our approximation or our simplified solution turns out to be?

I was thinking about the most important things about my life, about the things that I give the the highest importance. What are the most important things that motivate me? Time to time they change and I don't like that. It now has given me enough evidence to be skeptical about my own motivations. Things that matter to me even months before are sometimes no longer as important as it appeared to be. There are things that were highly valuable to me and I was absolutely determined to finish. But eventually those same things stopped motivating me. I know it's normal for a human being. But when I look back, it doesn't feel that good. I wish I could have been more determined mind. I wish I could have done things in rather different way. I wish I wouldn't go to places I went... But importantly these are all past I am thinking about. The only thing I have now is this present moment and the only thing I can change is my future. Probably what I can do is I can scrutinize the harsh past, I can cherry pick the good moments from the past and dedicatedly try to replicate them again. Almost in every moment in our life, we want to do the right things. Life is difficult for sure. As I was thinking recently that sometimes being deluded, taking things simply are probably the best way to pass the moments. Overanalyzing may not always help. Of course we all know that analyzing is okay, it's the bad analysis which is not okay. Over analysis is not always the proper analysis, I mean. I was thinking about my emotions, I was thinking about my drives like like what we team about success like link was taking the morning when the most important **************************************************************************************** thing for everyone should be to know about yourself to to know about the people around you and me going in scientific arms to live soundings that you leave your every moment but then then like in any source inquiry in any society in any sour call why we finally segregate us like I don't like to hang out it people are my own like to go to start faces are like any we just choose not to just choose to what the things you need of course we have been in the moment we choose to moment three say that I'm not wanted to that I mean of course you benefit to yoursome results of course you believe that that's going to wanted to the one to do the right thing and then even though we wanted to do the right thing that was not the right then and we then we are all but your we are not admitting that all of the team is probably distinct that difficult for me because we have so many standards of you can easier the same team in so many different ways that we before going back and have these earnings to different discount largemouth you are is ringing update the SPL quite perplexing I mean we won't want to be smart we all want to be nice wedding some people turn out to be nice and the other people don't tend many that you please send believe the beginning want to be nice I mean any. If someone doesn't start thinking about remaining nice then he's a psychopath then then then we carnal to be not nice after the event passed by and that means from the way you also don't or can't predict how we are going to be have likely our behavior are everything wanting to the sum total of all the previous previous previous events of course we can affect how we can be have but we can't affect in a way that we can't affect and week weekend she only deter mine the future so broke the ancillary there are lots of different probabilities of different things to be happened and we should be ready for either of the resolves went however that means i.e. anything bought area from the things that I started talking soul so so so I was I was pending the most most disgusting thing left on all other disgusting or not but think how we value the same team different I know how but why why we value the same events differently make even any off course like the same event is going to be jobs to FriendFeed by different people that's that makes sense for the same people can naturally charge the same event differently and white dress together differently of course any dose are saying people to eat like every time but but not that much area are also than I said about myself I myself the value might my evaluation of different things change but I I would have been in Japan now and I would have ended up working in that popped up by the lake mind to fight and and I I I I have prevented myself in learning or experiencing so many things and experiencing now in that way off course I'm doing what I'm doing right now for these were these are the teams probably while is important to me that's why I didn't code new that life and that passing the site but that's not the point my point is I mean there were things that I have but they are quite contradictory weight want I really want that means what that means anybody really want and what take to there are some huge gaps and I know I am cycling around the same think of them confuse so the whole point is like I waste a lot of my energy for sure probably don't want to however this end of talks

This is what happened while I was cooking my lunch and programming on my computer. And this is just one of the myriads of time mismanagement of myself. Who doesn't do multitasking? I always do. Not only inside my computer I run more than 10 programs, but also in the real outer world, I try cooking, cleaning up my room, reading magazines, talking with her on the phone. I need to keep track of what's going on and where for all these different parallel jobs. Multitasking sometimes create confusion in my mind about the relative priorities of all these jobs. I end up spending hours on the less significant work, leaving the most important job away. Is it just the procrastination or something even more complex?

Title: Liber Abaci- The Book Of Calculation

Can you remember the first moment when you learnt how to count? Did your mom or dad teach it. How did you grasp the concept of Zero(0) for the first time. When is the first time you have been introduced to the writing of numbers.? - Preschool, primary school ? The decimal number system widely used in almost every culture, in every modern mathematics or non-mathematics book consists of the numbers using the digits of the form 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. We form a number by having place values(units, tens, hundreds, thousands) for these digits.  This numerals are called "Hindu-Arabic Numerals". Because in early years, in Europe, people were not familiar with them. They used to use roman numeral system. Anyone who have the slightest knowledge of advanced mathematics like cryptography etc/ can easily discover that with roman numerals it's nearly impossible to do advanced math. So, if this "Hindu-Arabic" numerals were not imported to west, probably all the progress we have made because of science would have been impossible. When I recently realized this, I was totally astounded. Now who has introduced "Hindu-Arabic" numerals to the west? Do you know "Fibonacci Number"s and Fibonacci Sequence 1, 1, 2(=1+1), 3(=1+2), 5(=2+3), 8(=3+5), 13(=5+8), 21(=8+13), 34(=13+21),...., F(n)(=F(n-1)+F(n-2)) which can interestingly be related to the growth of the population of rabbits. Fibonacci is the nickname of Leonardo of Pisa. In 1202, he wrote a book on arithmetic called "Liber Abaci".The title means "The Book of Calculation" It was among the first Western books to describe those numerals. He popularized these numerals by addressing the applications of both commercial tradesmen and mathematicians. This is an excerpt from the book "Liber Abaci"- As my father was a public official away from our homeland in the Bugia customshouse established for the Pisan merchants who frequently gathered there, he had me in my youth brought to him, looking to find for me a useful and comfortable future; there he wanted me to be in the study of mathematics and to be taught for some days. There from a marvelous instruction in the art of the nine Indian figures, the introduction and knowledge of the art pleased me so much above all else, and I learnt from them, whoever was learned in it, from nearby Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily and Provence, and their various methods, to which locations of business I travelled considerably afterwards for much study, and I learnt from the assembled disputations. But this, on the whole, the algorithm and even the Pythagorean arcs, I still reckoned almost an error compared to the Indian method. Therefore strictly embracing the Indian method, and attentive to the study of it, from mine own sense adding some, and some more still from the subtle Euclidean geometric art, applying the sum that I was able to perceive to this book, I worked to put it together in xv distinct chapters, showing certain proof for almost everything that I put in, so that further, this method perfected above the rest, this science is instructed to the eager, and to the Italian people above all others, who up to now are found without a minimum. If, by chance, something less or more proper or necessary I omitted, your indulgence for me is entreated, as there is no one who is without fault, and in all things is altogether circumspect. The nine Indian figures are:9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1With these nine figures, and with the sign 0 which the Arabs call zephir any number whatsoever is written... I am glad that I was born in 19-th century to enjoy everything of the modern times.

Each and every day in our life is full of events. And each event or each occasion brings a bunch of choices to make. We have to decide what time we want to meet, what dress we want to wear, what food to avoid, what transport system to use etc. Making these choices are not always easy. Because with some few additional task, a simple task may turn out to be quite complex, may seem like a burden. Say you decided to take the highway I72 to reach your friend's wedding. Now suddenly your girlfriend called you and asked you to buy some staff from walmart before you go. You had to change your mind to take I72. Then when you were about to reach walmart, your other friend who was supposed to already reach the wedding  called you and started explaining why and how his car would not start up like a furious dude and requested you to pick him up for the wedding. As you can see, with these added complexities, a seemingly simple decision had to be changed. The worst part is that not always you can keep your mood well with these changes. Sometimes you have these bitter feelings, you can't smile anymore. Even though when you woke up, you were the happiest person of the day. And sometimes you decide not to do something for someone. Because you are not feeling to do so and probably just because you don't wanna change your mind for that time. That causes tension between relationship that you later regret about. I think you always need to be rational, apply logic to even solve your daily decision problems. But we can't always do that. Right!

Worried about distraction. Hard to focus on academic reading. It's probably simply the desire to avoid cognitive difficulty. Liked this blog. The points are: Edit your day. Plan the day ahead. Have notes. Sounds easy but very difficult to habituate. Clean out and organize bookmarks. Get rid of unnecessary stuffs. Simplicity is the best. Reduce and remove confusion as much as possible. Decide on undecided. Cleanliness ---> Good clothing ---> Confidence boost Reduce bad information consumption. Maintain time for mail reading. Reduce junk mail. No procrastination. You should know the procrastination equation. Meditation. Clear mind is important. Breath control is important too. Nutritious food. Fix things that need fixing, that tickles, causes itching. Sometimes let things go. Something which bothers a lot, which hangs for too long and which is unmanageable after significant amount of efforts.

Content:
I drive a lot. More than 200 miles a week on average. And on highways. Sometimes I cross the maximum speed limit of 70 mph. And I haven't been caught so far. But I have experienced police stopping other cars for speed limit violation. However, the moment I see someone getting tickets, I become very aware. I keep my speed as low as possible for several consecutive days. Then again I start crossing the limits until I experience the next punishment. I think crossing a little bit doesn't matter and Sheriffs also ignore such cars. But if you are driving more than 85mph that's dangerous and such drivers are likely to get caught. I won't say that I have never driven more than 85mph but definitely that's super rare for me. And my car is old though! It will grown. Most of the time I did violation was when I was in rush and in hurry not to make any late for an upcoming meeting. Sometimes when I don't take enough sleep the previous night, my driving becomes worse out of impulsive desires. However, it's interesting that when you see somebody else getting the punishment, your self-awareness increases. You kind of put the victim's shoe for a while and ask yourself "What if I were caught and had to pay?" This gave me the realization how law works in general in the society. Everybody knows and sees others violate laws and not everyone gets punished equally. Even they themselves do and regret. I am not talking about psychopaths who don't self reflect. I am talking about normal people. Even the law enforcement organizations also know that they are not going to make everyone abide by the rules. But the whole point of punishment is not just to punish that specific individual but to identify the bad example to make each and everyone cautious. And the more effectively a government can implement that, the more peaceful the citizens become there.. We probably can think even broadly, in a society everything we do everyday is just to set up some examples..

Not all mornings are sweet. Some mornings start with anxiety. The moment you open your eyes, you feel the full load of all the responsibilities you have for the day. Sometimes you jump out from the bed, wash your mouth and already start making your priorities: breakfast, library, meeting, writing, submitting, reading, presenting and so on.. Sometimes you don't feel to leave the bed. You tell your brain to shut up and leave everything aside and sleep again.. Not all mornings you get a kiss from her. Not all mornings she hugs you and wishes all the best for the rest of the day. Some morning, when she does, you feel like the king of the earth. You feel you can take all the responsibilities, finish them all and get back home to get another kiss on your lips.

Title: Does Ideology Matter?
Published Date: Sun, 03 May 2015 03:28:20 +0000
Categories & Tags: Analysis
Content:
I have been talking with a friend about whether ideology matters in our life? It seems "Ideology" has no role in our everyday life. But is that true? Certainly every person has his own outlook towards life and prefer to take certain stance over all other possible stances. It surely depends on how we have been taught, what school we went, what society we have been living. And our belief, attitudes toward life should definitely have some sort of relationship with the ideologies which were dominant in our environment. However, I was searching on google "Does Idelogy Matter?" And I came in touch with some interesting articles, specially a chapter from a book called "Introduction: The Debate over Ideology" by John Schwarzmantel. I got intrigued by some of the sentences by the writer in the first chapter which I will mention next: It seeks to present the features of those ideas which move people to action in the contemporary world, and seeks to answer the question of whether we are in a post-ideological society, in which the ideas that dominated the modern world and spawned mass movements, political parties and demands for revolutionary change, have lost their appeal. Have these inspiring ideals ceased to mobilise people, and been replaced by other ideologies, of different nature and origin, with completely transformed political implications? Or is the picture a different one, in which political life, at least in ‘developed’ countries, is marked precisely by an absence of overarching ideas or ideologies, with scepticism and hostility to such broad ideologies as characteristics of our time? He points out that the political ideologies have moved people to action in the past: In more mundane and less dramatic forms, political life in many countries has been animated by hundreds, indeed thousands of people engaging in political activity, sometimes of a very humdrum kind, because they believed that they were making some contribution, however small, to the victory of their ‘cause’. So there seems plenty of historical evidence that politics can not be understood without comprehension of ideas or packages of political ideas that have mobilised people to political activity, at whatever level. We are talking here not just of great leaders, charis- matic orators, founders or leaders of political parties, but of masses of people who found in political ideals an inspiration and a cause. Then he poses the doubt whether it's also the same now? Has the shape of the contemporary world, or its ideological configuration, shifted, so that instead of mobilisation for visions of ‘the good society’ we now live in a society focused on maintaining certain identities, and defending a group’s dignity, or respect? He brought the suggestion of philosopher "Charles Taylor" about equal recognition of our identity: A politics of equal recognition has come to play a bigger and bigger role’ (Taylor, 1994: 37). We want to be recognised as beings of equal dignity, which includes recognition of our particular identity, which gives us a sense of authenticity...The political life of contemporary ‘developed’ societies, and perhaps worldwide, is dominated by a struggle for recognition and respect. The overall aim is that one’s authentic culture, religion and customs are given ‘space’ and respect. This then takes priority over more ideological concerns, which are broader and more sweeping in their scope. Ideas of liberalism, socialism, conservatism, among others, offer more general aspirations, and stem from a common ‘Western’ heritage. Then he says why in a multicultural world someone who is of different origin may not be interested and how there can be a crisis of ideologies: ...may not be appealing to those whose cultural origins lie elsewhere, who reject the proclaimed universality of those ideals of ‘Left’ and ‘Right’, and seek recognition and respect. This would account for a crisis of ide- ologies, in which the main ideologies of the Western tradition have lost their mobilising capacity. This would be, at least in part, because those ideologies have a certain cultural underpinning, operate with certain assumptions of progress, rationality, secularism and with a certain pretension to universality. These are all assumptions which have come under suspicion in a much more multicultural world which exalts difference and diversity, and which is more receptive to identity than to ideology. He asked: ...whether in truth identity has replaced or reduced the importance of ideology, or whether new ideologies which give more importance to ‘the politics of recognition’ have superseded older ideologies which underplayed issues of cultural identity. American philosopher Richard Rorty distinguishes between "ideological politics and issue politics". Rorty's argument is that: A politics of ‘movements’ orients political action to some grand overar- ching aim. Particular issues are judged in terms of their contribution to the final goal of overall social transformation. The implication is that the present may be sacrificed in the light of a better future. The movement is way more important than the final goal. Movement politics can equally be called ideological politics. On the other hand Rorty calls campaigns the issue politics. The definition of campaign is given in this way: Campaigns are precisely about issues, about specific matters which are fought for in a limited way: rights of a particular group, a particular instance of environmental pollution or contamination, for instance. When people take to the streets in the societies of contemporary liberal democracy, it is on particular matters: protests against going to war in Iraq, a demonstration against tuition fees for university students, protests against reform of pension laws and welfare measures.. Campaigns have a finite perspective. They are not seen as contributing to a future and a different society but wish for change in the present, without the aspiration to build a new society. He thinks that the ideological politics has been replaced by issue or campaign politics: We are in a society of a ‘post-ideological’ kind, where it is not the struggle to create a better and totally different society, which occupies that section of the society, itself perhaps a minority, which engages with political activity....We have become a society focusing on issues which are remediable in the here and now. It seems very true to me. We are now really living in a society where we don't want everything to be changed. We just probably want improvement of situations and we extremely love to complain. However the author then declares that this is a false distinction: Any struggle for a particular issue, or campaign, can only be justified in terms of a general philosophy, or ideology. To protest against a motorway or out-of-town supermarket is to be spurred on, maybe only implicitly, by a general ideology of ecologism or green politics. To join in a march against war in Iraq might not be necessarily consciously equated to an affiliation to socialism or any ideology of the Left, but it seems to fit in with a broader philosophy of preferring peaceful resolutions of conflicts though international organisations such as the United Nations rather than the hegemony of the United States. Then he claims: Issues can only be identified as such within the framework provided by more general frameworks of ideological politics which give a map of the world, metaphorically speaking, and make it possible to specify why some- thing is an issue and is worth fighting about, or demonstrating about. He talks about totalising or totalistic ideologies and partial or fragmented ideologies. The totalistic ideology invokes a picture of overall social and political transformation. But the latter takes a less holistic view of society and social change and only tries to remedy specific grievances. And where the sacrifice of the present generation for the sake of some future goal is refused. There are more detailed explanation along this line throughout the first chapter. And in the end, it is shown to be evident that the situation now is different: The situation now is different and more problematic, in that while aspira- tions to community and to a better or more satisfying society remain strong, they are more difficult to realise in a society which is not only more frag- mented, but where the goals of community have to be recast at an international level.... The nation-state is now a much weaker building block, since it has been hollowed out both internally, by a variety of cultures, and externally, by flows of market forces... ...in the present situation, the forging of such sentiments of national solidarity, and of other kinds of community as well, comes up against greater obstacles or problems. How the movements of people and commodities are bringing changes: ...the much greater movements of immigration and flows of people and commodities across national borders have created aggregations of people to whom the traditional ideologies are of diminishing relevance... ...is to assert firstly that integrative and mobilising ideologies of politics are necessary in the contem- porary world, but, secondly, that the available ones are so badly crippled by changes in real life that they (and the aspirations they articulate) have to be reformulated in ways that may make them unrecognisably different from their previous forms. We are probably living in "beyond left and right": Giddens argues that the traditional antithesis of Left and Right is no longer appropriate to describe the ideological scene of contemporary liberal-democratic societies. The Left,  used to be in the vanguard of progress and modernity, standing for an egalitarian society in which the state had a crucial redistributive role, exemplified by the welfare state. Yet this idea of a directing and coordinating state, which acts in a somewhat paternalistic way, is out-of-date in a more complex society of ‘reflexive modernity’. Such a society is marked by greater individualism, a rejection of the state imposing uniform ways of satisfying people’s needs. ..the traditional Right is in equal difficulties. Appeals to traditional authority and a concept of hierarchy, both of which were central to old-style conservatism in Britain and elsewhere, havelost their relevance in a society where tradition is a much weaker force, where a more educated population rejects the deference and acceptance of estab- lished institutions on which parties of the conservative Right used to rely... The conclusion drawn is that in a society beyond Left and Right, a new ideological approach is needed, which focuses more on ‘lifestyle politics’, issues of consumption, individualism and the pri- vate sphere which the established ideologies of the past neglected. However, I want to finish with his final argument: It is argued here that this does not make ideologies redundant, but on the contrary that the impoverishment of much of political life in liberal-democratic societies stems precisely from the weakness of ideological politics – the lack of broad visions which offer a goal to be striven for. Ideology is needed actually.

I think we love ourselves the most. But yet interestingly we probably love to see ourselves in pain. The choice that we make, the decisions that we take sometimes surprise our own selves. You want to be so big sometimes, you want to be seen, you want to be the twinkling star in the sky who can glow and glitter. And you want to hide under the table other day. You cringe thinking about your own thoughts and deeds. You lie to yourself. You punish yourself. Then you change your colors. You try to forget yourself. You try to rebound. And you succeed.. And then the next dark hole is waiting for your delusional being and mind. Why do our mind always crave closure? As if everything needs to make sense, everything needs to be taken care of, everything needs to be settled down. Pain that you feel does nothing to you at all. You are a constant confusion, you are a bullshit.

Lafayette was full of color, full of music and full of excitement tonight. It turned into a place of absolute joy crowded with boys and girls, men and women who wanted nothing but to have the most pleasurable evening of their lives. They were dancing, drinking and were being mesmerized. The sky was bright with  fireworks of different shapes and colors as if the sky also needed to express solidarity. The gentle breeze was perfectly creating an atmosphere where milds can meld into love, lovers can whisper, hug and kiss. Music was bringing the rhythm in every movement of every single person who was part of this gorgeous fest. All were happy with the foods around. All the nice local restaurants opened their stall and were selling great food. There were more than two stages for musicians and singers for performing various music to entertain viewers. The band who sang some great country songs just before the midnight were truly professional and the whole crowd really enjoyed it. After midnight, it now became calm and quiet again. And everybody is returning with bliss in their mind. And lastly this awesome performance of country music: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA2Bbq_sKQA]

I had insufficient ideas about Capitalism, communism, Fascism and socialism. Throughout human history, we have seen different types of governance, economic systems in different part of the world. Political and economic policies very often were shaped by the ideas of these four systems. I liked the brief summary in this article from an English Course at University of Idaho which gave me a general idea about them. Trying to make a contrast  just to keep track of my reading these concepts.. Will try to read and write more. No. Characteristics Capitalism Socialism Communism Fascism 1. Ownership of the means of production Privately owned Owned by central state Owned by community Primarily owned by a dictator 2. What determines the investment of capital? A free market, rather than by state. Profit driven system. State, rather than by free market. Community requirement etc. Will and desire of the powerfuls. 3. Public property/Privatization In pure capitalism, no public schools, no state owned or maintained roads and highways, public works, welfare, unemployment insurance, workers compensation, social security benefits etc. Everything is privatized. State owns or maintain  roads and highways, public works, welfare, unemployment insurance, workers compensation, social security benefits etc. In a pure socialist state, state owns and operate the means of production. Communities owns or maintain the means of production. 4. Religion Humanism Humanism State sponsored Any 5. Personal Growth, Individuality, Creativity High as individuals can earn status Low personal growth. Individuals are not focussed. Low. Low as everything is for him and him only. 6. Power/Governance in hands of Upper class/corporations Elite/people Low/middle class Elected congressional members 7. Centralized control/ Centralized Banking No Yes Yes Yes 8. Historically America Western Europe Soviet Union Nazi Germany, Italy, Rome 9. Equality-Freedom in general Low equality - High Freedom High(somewhat) Equality- High Freedom High equality- Low Freedom Low Equality- Low Freedom ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Reposting some interesting part of the article. "These are complex concepts concerning both economics and government ..... these concepts are not always mutually exclusive (most modern states combine elements of more than one).... some of the terms refer strictly to economic systems (capitalism) while others (fascism) also refer to government and economic systems (communism and fascism). " United States is a Constitutional Democratic Republic that has long embraced both capitalism (free markets) and socialism (public schools and universities, and public works – parks, roads and highways, sewer and water, dams, harbors, as well as social welfare, such as worker’s comp, unemployment insurance, social security etc.). Capitalism An economic system in which all or most of the means of production are privately owned and operated, the investment of capital and the production, distribution and prices of commodities (goods and services) are determined mainly in a free market, rather than by the state. Socialism "State ownershipof common property, or state ownership of the means of production.  A purely socialist state would be one in which the state owns and operates the means of production. Communism Most generally, communism refers to community ownership of property, with the end goal being complete social equality via economic equality.  Communism is generally seen by communist countries as an idealized utopian economic and social state that the country as a whole is working toward. Fundamentally, communism argues that all labor belongs to the individual laborer; no man can own another man's body, and therefore each man owns his own labor.  In this model all "profit" actually belongs in part to the laborer, not, or not just, those who control the means of production, such as the business or factory owner.  Profit that is not shared with the laborer, therefore, is considered inherently exploitive. Fascism “A governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism.” Other interesting Tables: http://texags.com/forums/16/topics/1386979

Title: Poetic moments in the midst of ...

I always loved reading, specially poetry and novels. Even though most of the recent books that I have read are mainly non-fiction books, but I do have weakness for fictions and fictitious imaginations of poets and novelists. The combination of words which can touch our hearts are really amaze.. We all probably agree that words, sentences are great and probably the best medium to express ourselves thoroughly. When you are verbal you are more emotional, but when you are writing, I think you may turn out to be quite different, imaginative. Poems, novels are probably one step further than the normal words we use in our everyday life. Poets and novelists can arrange the words in beautiful ways to depict the beauty of life, the sorrow of living, the power of encouragement, the strength of inspiration and what not. I believe words never die as they get imprinted. "Touched by An Angel" is a great poem about the power of love: how it can bring ecstasies in our lives, how our lives are entangled with the memories of pleasure and pain and how love can make us brave. Touched by An Angel by Maya Angelou We, unaccustomed to courage exiles from delight live coiled in shells of loneliness until love leaves its high holy temple and comes into our sight to liberate us into life. Love arrives and in its train come ecstasies old memories of pleasure ancient histories of pain. Yet if we are bold, love strikes away the chains of fear from our souls. We are weaned from our timidity In the flush of love's light we dare be brave And suddenly we see that love costs all we are and will ever be. Yet it is only love which sets us free. The second one was "A Dream Within A Dream". It was asking whether all our dreams are just a part of another dream... interesting. A Dream Within A Dream by Edgar Allan Poe Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow-- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream. I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand-- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep--while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?

Title: When you lose

Content:
Life sometimes takes you into situations you never imagined to encounter. Your dreams get shattered, your heart feels like ripped out and you feel so lonely and helpless that even the existence of your own self gives you extreme guilt.  You definitely suffer because of your own irresponsible actions. But it's not that simple as you can't always control your actions in a multidimensional complex world with so many external agents influencing your choice and you can not be constantly lucky to get through every disaster you have fallen into. When you understand your own mistakes, the next question that you ask "If I believe that I am not actually an unreasonable person, what led me to those irresponsible acts?". With all different events, both desirable and undesirable, sometimes you just lose control and the life car that you were driving just skids off the road. Failures in life are more common than successes but wise men say that failing is not the problem, rather losing your ability to resiliently tackle after being knocked down to take the control of the situation is the problem. But your mind falls into the vicious cycles of all negative emotions: restlessness, blame, horror, guilt, anger, revenge. You know that everything is inside your mind and you need to trick your mind by engaging yourself into something that relieves you. But unfortunately you lack the power of diverting your mind into something productive and you again and again wander around the landscape of you your bad past. "Being in the present or staying here" is one of the most successful strategy that you should take for doing something meaningful to you. What I Want Poet: Unknown I Am Powerful! Whatever I set my mind on having, I will have. Whatever I decide to be, I will be. The evidence is all around me. The power of my Will has brought me precisely to where I am right now. I have made the choices. I have held the thoughts. I have taken the actions to create my current reality. And I have the power to change it into whatever I want it to be. With the choices I make, I am constantly fulfilling the vision I have for my life. If that does not seem to be the case - Then I am deceiving myself about what I really want. Because what I really, truly want, I will get! What I truly wanted in the past, I already have. If I want to build a billion-dollar business, I will take the actions necessary to do it. If I want to sit comfortably watching TV night after night - I will take the actions necessary for that. Don't be disappointed in my results - they're just the outward manifestation of my priorities. I will be sure of what I truly want, because I am sure to get it!

Is it really very difficult to overcome your own weaknesses? It seems that it is not very difficult to find out an optimal strategy which can reduce the amount of stress you face due to your mismanagement. There are certain desires which are strong and continuously try to mislead from your day to day goal. So, even after knowing the strategy, the execution takes tremendous amount of effort. It's really hard sometimes to force yourself to engage into cognitively difficult work. On top of that, your emotional state plays a significant role on how smoothly your are going to follow the planned strategies and execute each operation - simple to complex. Sometimes the priorities are not well maintained. You just get obsessed to some particular job even though its priority is not the highest which actually is a very bad strategy. It's also very difficult to strictly put the job and get it done in an exact or a fixed time slice. There's always some lagging behind and feeling remorseful for not utilizing your time properly. Sometimes we feel terribly bad for our own past actions which caused just frustration. There are also biological/physical constraints which make you even more incompetent. So, knowing is not enough, rather keeping yourself in work is the key to all accomplishments. Every productive work you do makes you feel like you are the creator of your own work, every contribution that you successfully make adds more to your self esteem, but it's just immensely hard to keep your motivation up. That's why human interaction is needed. That's why we seek for evaluation, want to get validated by others who care. Inspiration to live and grow your ability is important. Then a lot of care need to be given to how you plan to avoid the boredom that suck you into vicious cycles of nothingness.

My life has turned into a never ending cycle of dreamlessness and meaninglessness. Every morning I wake up and plan to pass it in a productive way. But the negative thoughts and all the associated memories drag me down every single time. Sometimes I make some progress by concentrating to my responsibilities and interacting with friends and families but then again the loneliness suck me into the blackhole. I feel the guilt of not maintaining what I should have prioritized, I feel ashamed of the bad acts I have never truly intended to do. I can't find the answer why things turned so much against me. My nightmares continue giving me pain and frighten me with hopelessness. I had an unhappy stressful childhood. There were severely bad times in my past that I thought I became successful to overcome. But now I am back with my depression again.

It was a sad night full of frightening dreams. I had to stay inside my car in the shivering cold outside, only could sleep one or two hours. I wanted to sleep more. But again the disturbing thoughts grasped me in the morning.  I was thinking about suicide and all possible ways to do it. Don't know why I'm writing all these in a public blog. It's really hard when you feel rejected and betrayed, specially by someone you took care of most of your time. I don't know why people can be so cruel sometimes, why people only remember your bad actions where as you could focus on your good ones. Life is full of stress which just sometimes force you to underperform but you expect your closed ones to understand the situation. But not always you are so lucky to be understood. It's not clear to me for what big reasons I am suffering so much. It's not clear for me why I'm even  letting myself suffer like this. I know what things I should do to relieve myself, what I should not concentrate or focus on. But still the cyclical thoughts about my sweet and bad pasts are haunting me all the time and taking me to the same situation again and again. I just can't let some thing go away as they are so precious to me, they are so attached to my existence. I know I need to explore in somewhere else but I have this destructible force inside me that will make me come to that same house, same location. I understand my guilts, I understand my limitations, but I don't understand fully how my mind works. I believed myself to be a very strong character who can handle things cleverly, who always focused on the brighter side of everything and moved past the darkness. But now I no longer can consider myself a rational positive person who can overcome his distress. I have tremendous amount of experience living in lonely places with people you can't communicate due to the lack of knowledge of a new language, I have experience of passing difficult nights moving from one city to another, even one country to another to fulfill my goals, I have experience to win over complex situations handling so many types of people. But no experience is helping me out from the situation I am in right now. I just feel to get stuck with things that seem to never change anymore.

Sometimes I like to do intense study in noisy places. I remember I used to hear music very loudly during the preparation for my public exams. It's kind of like shutting all the disturbing voices inside my mind by those loud musics and then forcing my studious mind concentrate to reading and writing. Sometimes I just get super surprised to find so many voices inside me blabbering and rushing me from one corner of the universe to another. Recently I heard a lecture called "Waking Up" by Sam Harris and he tried to very eloquently explain this exact phenomenon. He was giving an example which was really interesting and made people laugh out loud. Sam was standing in front of everybody on the stage and talking about why and how spiritual experiences can have profound impact on us and why we should have secular views for our spiritual experiences. A glass full of water was kept on top of the table so that Sam can drink when thirsty while speaking to the audience. But when Sam became conscious about the glass of water, Sam heard the voice inside his head, "Oh look. There's a glass of water for me." Sam then tried to make the point that we do this kind of validating conversation to ourselves all the time. And he joked "Who I am telling that when I can just see it?" It's like we try to grasp the reality surrounding us by talking directly to ourselves. We express our own wonder, annoyance, honest or dishonest, positive or negative feelings to some invisible ghost who live inside our brain. Right now I am at a starbucks at Purdue. Recently I have been studying at starbucks very often. So many people are having loud conversation, quite loud background music is being played, but still I'm not having any problem concentrating to my study. I can also remember those days when I used to study inside fast moving trains. I really enjoy all the rush around me. I think I do love people around me. It just makes me feel to move.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/13/what-is-love-five-theories love is a powerful neurological condition like hunger or thirst, only more permanent. We talk about love being blind or unconditional, in the sense that we have no control over it. But then, that is not so surprising since love is basically chemistry. While lust is a temporary passionate sexual desire involving the increased release of chemicals such as testosterone and oestrogen, in true love, or attachment and bonding, the brain can release a whole set of chemicals: pheromones, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, oxytocin and vasopressin. However, from an evolutionary perspective, love can be viewed as a survival tool – a mechanism we have evolved to promote long-term relationships, mutual defence and parental support of children and to promote feelings of safety and security. Philia which they saw as a deep but usually non-sexual intimacy between close friends and family members or as a deep bond forged by soldiers as they fought alongside each other in battle. Ludus describes a more playful affection found in fooling around or flirting. Pragma is the mature love that develops over a long period of time between long-term couples and involves actively practising goodwill, commitment, compromise and understanding. Agape is a more generalised love, it's not about exclusivity but about love for all of humanity. Philautia is self love, which isn't as selfish as it sounds. As Aristotle discovered and as any psychotherapist will tell you, in order to care for others you need to be able to care about yourself. Last, and probably least even though it causes the most trouble, eros is about sexual passion and desire. Unless it morphs into philia and/or pragma, eros will burn itself out.

Blackman and Tuckey prescribed some techniques to analyze a continuous spectrum that was biased by the presence of sidelobes of strong peaks. Blackman-Tuckey(BT) method was developed before 1958, prior to the FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) method. A discrete fourier transform of N points would require the calculation of $N^2$ sines and cosines. With the slower computer in the pre-FFT days, BT method has reduced the time by reducing the size of the dataset by a factor of the lag in the autocorrelation calculation. BT method is based on a fundamental theorem of Fourier transform that the Fourier transform of a correlation is equal to the product of the Fourier transforms. The correlation of two functions $g(t)$ and $h(t)$ is given by the first equation below.

Title: Evolutionary history
Published Date: None
Categories & Tags: Home
Content:
There are all sorts of ways to reconstruct the history of life on Earth. Pinning down when specific events occurred is often tricky, though. For this, biologists depend mainly on dating the rocks in which fossils are found, and by looking at the “molecular clocks” in the DNA of living organisms. There are problems with each of these methods. The fossil record is like a movie with most of the frames cut out. Because it is so incomplete, it can be difficult to establish exactly when particular evolutionary changes happened. Modern genetics allows scientists to measure how different species are from each other at a molecular level, and thus to estimate how much time has passed since a single lineage split into different species. Confounding factorsrack up for species that are very distantly related, making the earlier dates more uncertain. These difficulties mean that the dates in the timeline should be taken as approximate. As a general rule, they become more uncertain the further back along the geological timescale we look. Dates that are very uncertain are marked with a question mark. 3.8 billion years ago? This is our current “best guess” for the beginning of life on Earth. It is distinctly possible that this date will change as more evidence comes to light. The first life may have developed in undersea alkaline vents, and was probably based on RNA rather than DNA. At some point far back in time, a common ancestor gave rise to two main groups of life: bacteria and archaea. How this happened, when, and in what order the different groups split, is still uncertain. 3.5 billion years ago The oldest fossils of single-celled organisms date from this time. 3.46 billion years ago Some single-celled organisms may be feeding on methane by this time. 3.4 billion years ago Rock formations in Western Australia, that some researchers claim are fossilised microbes, date from this period. 3 billion years ago Viruses are present by this time, but they may be as old as life itself. 2.4 billion years ago The “great oxidation event”. Supposedly, the poisonous waste produced by photosynthetic cyanobacteria – oxygen – starts to build up in the atmosphere. Dissolved oxygen makes the iron in the oceans “rust” and sink to the seafloor, forming striking banded iron formations. Recently, though, some researchers have challenged this idea. They think cyanobacteria only evolved later, and that other bacteria oxidised the iron in the absence of oxygen. Yet others think that cyanobacteria began pumping out oxygen as early as 2.1 billion years ago, but that oxygen began to accumulate only due to some other factor, possibly a decline in methane-producing bacteria. Methane reacts with oxygen, removing it from the atmosphere, so fewer methane-belching bacteria would allow oxygen to build up. 2.3 billion years ago Earth freezes over in what may have been the first “snowball Earth”, possibly as a result of a lack of volcanic activity. When the ice eventually melts, it indirectly leads to more oxygen being released into the atmosphere. 2.15 billion years ago First undisputed fossil evidence of cyanobacteria, and of photosynthesis: the ability to take in sunlight and carbon dioxide, and obtain energy, releasing oxygen as a by-product. There is some evidence for an earlier date for the beginning of photosynthesis, but it has been called into question. 2 billion years ago? Eukaryotic cells – cells with internal “organs” (known as organelles) – come into being. One key organelle is the nucleus: the control centre of the cell, in which the genes are stored in the form of DNA. Eukaryotic cells evolved when one simple cell engulfed another, and the two lived together, more or less amicably – an example of “endosymbiosis”. The engulfed bacteria eventually become mitochondria, which provide eukaryotic cells with energy. The last common ancestor of all eukaryotic cells had mitochondria – and had also developed sexual reproduction. Later, eukaryotic cells engulfed photosynthetic bacteria and formed a symbiotic relationship with them. The engulfed bacteria evolved into chloroplasts: the organelles that give green plants their colour and allow them to extract energy from sunlight. Different lineages of eukaryotic cells acquired chloroplasts in this way on at least three separate occasions, and one of the resulting cell lines went on to evolve into all green algae and green plants. 1.5 billion years ago? The eukaryotes divide into three groups: the ancestors of modern plants, fungi and animals split into separate lineages, and evolve separately. We do not know in what order the three groups broke with each other. At this time they were probably all still single-celled organisms. 900 million years ago? The first multicellular life develops around this time. It is unclear exactly how or why this happens, but one possibility is that single-celled organisms go through a stage similar to that of modern choanoflagellates: single-celled creatures that sometimes form colonies consisting of many individuals. Of all the single-celled organisms known to exist, choanoflagellates are the most closely related to multicellular animals, lending support to this theory. 800 million years ago The early multicellular animals undergo their first splits. First they divide into, essentially, the sponges and everything else – the latter being more formally known as the Eumetazoa. Around 20 million years later, a small group called the placozoa breaks away from the rest of the Eumetazoa. Placozoa are thin plate-like creatures about 1 millimetre across, and consist of only three layers of cells. It has been suggested that they may actually be the last common ancestor of all the animals. 770 million years ago The planet freezes over again in another “snowball Earth“. 730 million years ago The comb jellies (ctenophores) split from the other multicellular animals. Like the cnidarians that will soon follow, they rely on water flowing through their body cavities to acquire oxygen and food. 680 million years ago The ancestor of cnidarians (jellyfish and their relatives) breaks away from the other animals – though there is as yet no fossil evidence of what it looks like. 630 million years ago Around this time, some animals evolve bilateral symmetry for the first time: that is, they now have a defined top and bottom, as well as a front and back. Little is known about how this happened. However, small worms called Acoela may be the closest surviving relatives of the first ever bilateral animal. It seems likely that the first bilateral animal was a kind of worm. Vernanimalcula guizhouena, which dates from around 600 million years ago, may be the earliest bilateral animal found in the fossil record. 590 million years ago The Bilateria, those animals with bilateral symmetry, undergo a profound evolutionary split. They divide into the protostomes and deuterostomes. The deuterostomes eventually include all the vertebrates, plus an outlier group called the Ambulacraria. The protostomes become all the arthropods (insects, spiders, crabs, shrimp and so forth), various types of worm, and the microscopic rotifers. Neither may seem like an obvious “group”, but in fact the two can be distinguished by the way their embryos develop. The first hole that the embryo acquires, the blastopore, forms the anus in deuterostomes, but in protostomes it forms the mouth. 580 million years ago The earliest known fossils of cnidarians, the group that includes jellyfish, sea anemones and corals, date to around this time – though the fossil evidence has been disputed. 575 million years ago Strange life forms known as the Ediacarans appear around this time and persist for about 33 million years. 570 million years ago A small group breaks away from the main group of deuterostomes, known as the Ambulacraria. This group eventually becomes the echinoderms (starfish, brittle stars and their relatives) and two worm-like families called the hemichordates and Xenoturbellida. Another echinoderm, the sea lily, is thought to be the “missing link” between vertebrates (animals with backbones) and invertebrates (animals without backbones), a split that occurred around this time. 565 million years ago Fossilised animal trails suggest that some animals are moving under their own power. 540 million years ago As the first chordates – animals that have a backbone, or at least a primitive version of it – emerge among the deuterostomes, a surprising cousin branches off. The sea squirts (tunicates) begin their history as tadpole-like chordates, but metamorphose partway through their lives into bottom-dwelling filter feeders that look rather like a bag of seawater anchored to a rock. Their larvae still look like tadpoles today, revealing their close relationship to backboned animals. 535 million years ago The Cambrian explosion begins, with many new body layouts appearing on the scene – though the seeming rapidity of the appearance of new life forms may simply be an illusion caused by a lack of older fossils. 530 million years ago The first true vertebrate – an animal with a backbone – appears. It probably evolves from a jawless fish that has a notochord, a stiff rod of cartilage, instead of a true backbone. The first vertebrate is probably quite like a lamprey, hagfish or lancelet. Around the same time, the first clear fossils of trilobites appear. These invertebrates, which look like oversized woodlice and grow to 70 centimetres in length, proliferate in the oceans for the next 200 million years. 520 million years ago Conodonts, another contender for the title of “earliest vertebrate“, appear. They probably look like eels. 500 million years ago Fossil evidence shows that animals were exploring the land at this time. The first animals to do so were probably euthycarcinoids – thought to be the missing link between insects and crustaceans. Nectocaris pteryx, thought to be the oldest known ancestor of the cephalopods – the group that includes squid – lives around this time. 489 million years ago The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event begins, leading to a great increase in diversity. Within each of the major groups of animals and plants, many new varieties appear. 465 million years ago Plants begin colonising the land. 460 million years ago Fish split into two major groups: the bony fish and cartilaginous fish. The cartilaginous fish, as the name implies, have skeletons made of cartilage rather than the harder bone. They eventually include all the sharks, skates and rays. 440 million years ago The bony fish split into their two major groups: the lobe-finned fish with bones in their fleshy fins, and the ray-finned fish. The lobe-finned fish eventually give rise to amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The ray-finned fish thrive, and give rise to most fish species living today. The common ancestor of lobe-finned and ray-finned fish probably has simple sacs that function as primitive lungs, allowing it to gulp air when oxygen levels in the water fall too low. In ray-finned fish, these sacs evolve into the swim bladder, which is used for controlling buoyancy. 425 million years ago The coelacanth, one of the most famous “living fossils” – species that have apparently not changed for millions of years – splits from the rest of the lobe-finned fish. 417 million years ago Lungfish, another legendary living fossil, follow the coelacanth by splitting from the other lobe-finned fish. Although they are unambiguously fish, complete with gills, lungfish have a pair of relatively sophisticated lungs, which are divided into numerous smaller air sacs to increase their surface area. These allow them to breathe out of water and thus to survive when the ponds they live in dry out. 400 million years ago The oldest known insect lives around this time. Some plants evolve woody stems. 397 million years ago The first four-legged animals, or tetrapods, evolve from intermediate species such as Tiktaalik, probably in shallow freshwater habitats. The tetrapods go on to conquer the land, and give rise to all amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. 385 million years ago The oldest fossilised tree dates from this period. 375 million years ago Tiktaalik, an intermediate between fish and four-legged land animals, lives around this time. The fleshy fins of its lungfish ancestors are evolving into limbs. 340 million years ago The first major split occurs in the tetrapods, with the amphibians branching off from the others. 310 million years ago Within the remaining tetrapods, the sauropsids and synapsids split from one another. The sauropsids include all the modern reptiles, plus the dinosaurs and birds. The first synapsids are also reptiles, but have distinctive jaws. They are sometimes called “mammal-like reptiles”, and eventually evolve into the mammals. 320 to 250 million years ago The pelycosaurs, the first major group of synapsid animals, dominate the land. The most famous example is Dimetrodon, a large predatory “reptile” with a sail on its back. Despite appearances, Dimetrodon is not a dinosaur. 275 to 100 million years ago The therapsids, close cousins of the pelycosaurs, evolve alongside them and eventually replace them. The therapsids survive until the early Cretaceous, 100 million years ago. Well before that, a group of them called the cynodontsdevelops dog-like teeth and eventually evolves into the first mammals. 250 million years ago The Permian period ends with the greatest mass extinction in Earth’s history, wiping out great swathes of species, including the last of the trilobites. As the ecosystem recovers, it undergoes a fundamental shift. Whereas before the synapsids (first the pelycosaurs, then the therapsids) dominated, the sauropsids now take over – most famously, in the form of dinosaurs. The ancestors of mammals survive as small, nocturnal creatures. In the oceans, the ammonites, cousins of the modern nautilus and octopus, evolve around this time. Several groups of reptiles colonise the seas, developing into the great marine reptiles of the dinosaur era. 210 million years ago Bird-like footprints and a badly-preserved fossil called Protoavis suggest that some early dinosaurs are already evolving into birds at this time. This claim remains controversial. 200 million years ago As the Triassic period comes to an end, another mass extinction strikes, paving the way for the dinosaurs to take over from their sauropsid cousins. Around the same time, proto-mammals evolve warm-bloodedness – the ability to maintain their internal temperature, regardless of the external conditions. 180 million years ago The first split occurs in the early mammal population. The monotremes, a group of mammals that lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young, break apart from the others. Few monotremes survive today: they include the duck-billed platypus and the echidnas. 168 million years ago A half-feathered, flightless dinosaur called Epidexipteryx, which may be an early step on the road to birds, lives in China. 150 million years ago Archaeopteryx, the famous “first bird”, lives in Europe. 140 million years ago Around this time, placental mammals split from their cousins the marsupials. These mammals, like the modern kangaroo, that give birth when their young are still very small, but nourish them in a pouch for the first few weeks or months of their lives. The majority of modern marsupials live in Australia, but they reach it by an extremely roundabout route. Arising in south-east Asia, they spread into north America (which was attached to Asia at the time), then to south America and Antarctica, before making the final journey to Australia about 50 million years ago. 131 million years ago Eoconfuciusornis, a bird rather more advanced than Archaeopteryx, lives in China. 130 million years ago The first flowering plants emerge, following a period of rapid evolution. 105-85 million years ago The placental mammals split into their four major groups: the laurasiatheres (a hugely diverse group including all the hoofed mammals, whales, bats, and dogs), euarchontoglires (primates, rodents and others), Xenarthra (including anteaters and armadillos) and afrotheres (elephants, aardvarks and others). Quite how these splits occurred is unclear at present. 100 million years ago The Cretaceous dinosaurs reach their peak in size. The giant sauropod Argentinosaurus, believed to be the largest land animal in Earth’s history, lives around this time. 93 million years ago The oceans become starved of oxygen, possibly due to a huge underwater volcanic eruption. Twenty-seven per cent of marine invertebrates are wiped out. 75 million years ago The ancestors of modern primates split from the ancestors of modern rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas). The rodents go on to be astonishingly successful, eventually making up around 40 per cent of modern mammal species. 70 million years ago Grasses evolve – though it will be several million years before the vast open grasslands appear. 65 million years ago The Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T) extinction wipes out a swathe of species, including all the giant reptiles: the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. The ammonites are also wiped out. The extinction clears the way for the mammals, which go on to dominate the planet. 63 million years ago The primates split into two groups, known as the haplorrhines (dry-nosed primates) and the strepsirrhines (wet-nosed primates). The strepsirrhines eventually become the modern lemurs and aye-ayes, while the haplorrhines develop into monkeys and apes – and humans. 58 million years ago The tarsier, a primate with enormous eyes to help it see at night, splits from the rest of the haplorrhines: the first to do so. 55 million years ago The Palaeocene/Eocene extinction. A sudden rise in greenhouse gases sends temperatures soaring and transforms the planet, wiping out many species in the depths of the sea – though sparing species in shallow seas and on land. 50 million years ago Artiodactyls, which look like a cross between a wolf and a tapir, begin evolving into whales. 48 million years ago Indohyus, another possible ancestor of whales and dolphins, lives in India. 47 million years ago The famous fossilised primate known as “Ida” lives in northern Europe. Early whales called protocetids live in shallow seas, returning to land to give birth. 40 million years ago New World monkeys become the first simians (higher primates) to diverge from the rest of the group, colonising South America. 25 million years ago Apes split from the Old World monkeys. 18 million years ago Gibbons become the first ape to split from the others. 14 million years ago Orang-utans branch off from the other great apes, spreading across southern Asia while their cousins remain in Africa. 7 million years ago Gorillas branch off from the other great apes. 6 million years ago Humans diverge from their closest relatives; the chimpanzees and bonobos. Shortly afterwards, hominins begin walking on two legs. See our interactive timeline of human evolution for the full story of how modern humans developed. 2 million years ago A 700-kilogram rodent called Josephoartigasia monesi lives in South America. It is the largest rodent known to have lived, displacing the previous record holder: a giant guinea pig.

Title: Steven Pinker's Talk

Does the world become better than before? If you ask me, the answer is definitely. But, still, relatively or comparatively, the answer differs from different people. Do people living in Syria or Iraq feel better than before? I doubt it. Pinker comes across as a brilliant man with some glaring blind spots. Progress is inevitable, and it does make life better. Many of us owe our very lives to it, myself included. Human knowledge and accomplishment are cumulative - the Enlightenment did not give us wheels or agriculture, printing presses or sea travel. Progress gave us the Enlightenment, not the other way around. Mr. Pinker claims that intellectuals hate progress, when many intellectuals actually describe themselves as progressives, and it has always been through the work of intellectuals that progress has been made. He targets left-leaning media (NYT, CNN) when the right insists it will take us back to a bygone era that never existed. Pinker cherry-picks his areas of progress, and they are very human-centric. Climate change is not the only area of concern; human population continues to grow unchecked, species extinction is occurring at a never before seen pace, and we continue to pollute and exhaust fresh water supplies. We use improved crop yields with genetic modification to justify profligate use of herbicides. Global fish stocks are collapsing. There are other areas of trend line interest that deserve attention. Income disparity mushrooms. Progress in weaponry makes genocide and world war devastatingly effective (WWII made WWI seem tepid, and we shudder to imagine WWIII). Exponentially growing complexity increases human stress, at the same time automation is making the human work force vestigial. To the question: "Is the word getting better or worse?," the answer is a resounding, "yes." The late Lt. Colonel Robert Gayre said, "Change is not always progress, although it is often mistaken for it..." I found this talk painfully human-centric and myopic. Is the world getting better or worse? Measured by the 'progress' of any other species, it is getting steadily worse, by any numbers you care to look at. We are not facing a looming environmental crisis - it is happening right now, all around the world. Much of what is considered progress in human terms will simply enable more of us to be born, to demand more of what everyone else has. As a species, we are behaving more like a disease than like stewards and guardians of the web of life. The key to genuine progress? Increased biodiversity. https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_is_the_world_getting_better_or_worse_a_look_at_the_numbers/discussion?language=en No one really knows what the world population will be in fifty or more years, nine billion or less, nine billion or more. The thing that remains constant is that we, humans will keep on consuming the Earth's resources. Some resources are renewable and some are not. What will happen when we ran out of the non-renewable ones, like oil? What will happen to our oceans when we keep dumping more and more garbage in them? What will happen to our fresh water resources if we are not conserving them? What will happen to our agricultural lands if we keep converting them to residential and industrial? What will happen to our forests if the current trend of global warming continues; if we keep converting the rain forests to agricultural and industrial enterprises? What will happen to low-lying islands and countries if the polar ice caps keep melting and the oceans keep rising? One more thing: The Earth's resources are finite but human nature remains constant and human wants are infinite... This may sound dire, but if we turn around now and work collectively, our world will get even better! Will we make the right choices? How can one argue with one of the most eminent thinkers, writers, and educators of the 21st Century, especially when his work is supported by reliable data and endorsed by some of our most successful and respected citizens, like Mr. Bill Gates? There's no doubt our world is becoming better in many aspects of our lives. However, as Dr. Pinker addressed so eloquently, there are still "gargantuan problems" that need our collective attention: 1) The rapidly growing patches of garbage in our oceans, environmental degradation, and global warming. There was a time when our cities were littered with garbage and our oceans were cleaner. Now our cities are getting cleaner but our oceans are littered with "stuff". 2) The ever-growing menace of war (nuclear and biological weapons) and population explosion. There are limits to what our planet Earth can support and sustain. 3) The "us versus them" and "we're the good ones and they're the bad ones" mentality still prevail in some regions of the world. This mindset leads to conflicts. What gives us reason for hope and optimism? Today, more than ever, there are more concerned and enlightened citizens worldwide that care for their families and communities. There are also many more governmental and private organizations working hard to solve problems that had been given scant attention in the past. Thinking globally and working together locally, our world will even get much better!

Paleontology¶The study of fossils: their age, method of formation, and evolutionary significance. Biostratigraphy¶The branch of Paleontology where the identification of fossils found within sedimentary rock strata is used as a method of determining the relative geologic age(dating) of the rock. Geologic timescale creator¶A visualization software to visualize earth history What is a Fossil?¶A fossil is an organism, creature, plant or burrow that lived thousands or millions of years ago. Fossils are preserved in rock or clay. The first form of life evolved 4 billion years ago, but the first visible life was 2 billion years ago. Life on land first appeared 380 million years ago. How old can fossils be?¶Specimens are usually considered to be fossils if they are over 10,000 years old. The oldest fossils are from around 3.48 billion years old to 4.1 billion years old. Foraminifera : Planktonic and Benthic¶Planktonic is of or pertaining to plankton while benthic is pertaining to the benthos; living on the seafloor, as opposed to floating in the ocean. There are about 30 species of planktonic Foraminifera, as contrasted with the more than 4200 benthic species in the oceans of the world. Most of the planktonic species belong to the families Globigerinidae and Globo-rotaliidae. The Paleogene assemblage of planktonic foraminifera was derived from the few species that survive the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous. In the Early Miocene, the planktonic foraminifera were most abundant and diverse in the tropics and subtropics, and after the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, many species were adapted to populate temperate and sub-polar oceans. During the Middle and Late Pliocene, the final closure of the Central American seaway, changed oceanic circulation and drove a significant number of species extinctions. Most modern, living species originated in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. References: Armstrong, H. A., Brasier, M. D., 2005. Microfossils (2nd Ed). Blackwell, Oxford.

It gives every species a two-part scientific name. For example, a ladybug found in the United States goes by the fancy name of Harmonia axyridis. The first part of a scientific name, like Harmonia, is called the Genus. A genus is typically the name for a small group of closely related organisms. The second part of a scientific name, axyridis in this example, is the Species. It is used to identify a particular species as separate from others belonging to the same genus. Globanomalina pseudomenardii Globigerina binaiensis Globorotalia archeomenardii Globorotalia crassaformis Can we identify the "Genus Name" from the images of all the available species under that genus?¶ Fossil Image Data Processing¶ ### Image Data Total 236 fossil images used in this project. The foram species range from mid Jurassic(175 Ma) up to present. ### Number of Genus We have 79 different genus for this foraminifer fossil image dataset.

And we convert the genums names to categorical labels for training using one hot encoding vector of length 79. The vector contains binary 0 and only one 1 the index of which indicates the genus name for that fossil species.

It was a cloudy rainy day in the mid May when I landed in San Jose. I departed the beautiful Denvar, Colorado for San Jose the night before with the hope of enjoying the sunny bay area. So, I was surprised with the quirky weather. This was my first time in this farthest west of our pale blue earth. I used to live in Tokyo, the farthest east during my undergraduate years and I remembered my dreams of exploring this valley. And my dream came true. I still remember the excitement I felt that day. I am going to work in Silicon Valley for a company which is regarded as the backbone of Internet. With a little bit of surprise with this rare kind of weather, I hesitantly started walking in the airport. I rented a car and started driving towards my friend's house in mountainview. It's mid July now, almost exactly two months. And I was so busy enjoying the bay area that I barely found time for writing. I usually write in a coffeeshop while having my coffee on weekends. But I have apparently been involved in activities most of my weekends. Goal orientation My internship is coming great. I have been really enjoying my project. My project relates to creating an analytics tool which can extract meaningful network information from network devices, so that data analysts can make decisions. I love the Work environment. It's true silicon valley companies do like to entertain their employees with snacks, massage chairs so that we forget to leave the campus ! As I love to work, which has been a bonus for me. Driving near the shore in Los Angeles Hiking has been great. I have made friends. This is a heaven for vegans. I have explored many new vegan and vegeterian restaurants. Food Communication

It was a cloudy rainy day in the mid May when I landed in San Jose. I departed the beautiful Denvar, Colorado for San Jose the night before with the hope of enjoying the sunny bay area. So, I was surprised with the quirky weather. This was my first time in this farthest west of our pale blue planet. I used to live in Japan, the farthest east during my undergraduate years, when I was attending Osaka University. I remembered my desire of exploring silicon valley as a CS major and it came into fruition now. I was excited thinking about my upcoming internship job for the company which is regarded as the backbone of Internet. With a little bit of surprise with this rare kind of weather, I hesitantly started walking in the airport. I rented a car and started driving towards my friend's house in Mountainview. I wanted to live in a bit unconventional way for this summer. I wanted to embrace the explore the idea of digital nomadism in these days of AirBnb. As this is my first time in bay area, I decided to explore all the cities in the bay as much as possible. I wanted to literally live in different areas on different days. I chose not to rent a place for the entire summer, and rather relied on airbnb listings. I quickly bought a very reliable car which gives great gas milage and started living that way from my first week. It was pretty challenging for sure. But I started knowing more places and meeting people and making friends. This way of living forced me to stay outside most of the time. My day would start in the company gym, then work at the office with fellow interns and other coworkers and then the city explorations at night. This is a heaven for vegans. I have explored many new vegan and vegeterian restaurants. Every weekend I will meet some new people I love the work environment at my company. I enjoyed interacting with my coworkers. Everyone was very cooperative and it was very easy to reach out to people and ask questions. The open, expressive and caring culture among the people really intrigued me. Our company campus is really big with more than 30 buildings and as interns we started exploring the building facilities.

May be, 100,000$ per Bitcoin by the year 2040. So, are you owning/holding/trading/investing in Bitcoin for next 20 years? This is the bullish case. Different projections for Bitcoin price to go up to 100,000$ possibly by 2040. In the year 2017, we saw the last all time high (~20,000$). In 2019, we had another peak (~15,000). Due to Corona virus and current economic depression, we will possibly not see great growth until the recession starts to recover. However, all the peaks since the birth of Bitcoin is above the Bitcoin growth curve (yellow line that acts as the supporting base). The thin white lines are Bitcoin logarithmic growth curves which shows exponential growth of Bitcoin price leading to 1 million dollar by that time! However, that is overly optimistic. Bitcoin price is most likely follow the growth patterns shown with the green, red and purple lines. Those lines will reach 100,000$ mark in the year of 2031, 2035, 2038 respectively. And who knows, Bitcoin even can reach a 1 million dollar mark!! These lines may act as support and resistance many many times while keeping the same growth rate over a longer timeframe. This is speculation to persuade new Bitcoin users. Bitcoin only gains as long as it's more used, owned and invested, just like any other assets. The only difference in the case of Bitcoin is that, the growth rate will be much faster as Bitcoin, being decentralized cryptocoin and with a finite supply and with the security provided by the proof of work, is less likely to be manipulated by any entity. So, what's the bearish case. On the other hand, if people start disbelieving in Bitcoin, or people lose a lot of money because Bitcoin's security get compromised (unlikely!), or all the governments of all the countries decide to stop internet to block Bitcoin (unlikely!), or ban cryptocurrency exchanges or make them illegal like in some countries (likely!), or jail many many people for owning Bitcoin via fear mongering (unlikely!), or some other reasons for why speculators may lose interest, or some other crypto currency will reign over Bitcoin, Bitcoin price will not go as high as mentioned above(unlikely!). But, I believe it will still remain valuable (will stay above around the yellow line, maintaining around 20K price). Bitcoin will find itself in human history for a great experiment, no matter what. But, why not taking the bet? I am accumulating as many as possible. But when you invest, but we should also learn to diversify portfolio to spread the risk. Let's say you have 1000 dollar, then put 50$ (5% of 1000$) at least in Bitcoin, and then the rest you can put in valuable company stocks, real estates or whatever else is your favorite. I'm more inclined to put more! Let's be the rational bitcoiner. There is only 21 million bitcoin, if you own 1 bitcoin you will get into the 21 million bitcoiner club, if you own 21 bitcoin you will get into the 1 million bitcoiner club. #bitcoin #blockchain

I want to talk to you. But I also feel scared of feeling in a certain way which drags me down everytime. I know we all have our own problems in our present and adding more to that is sometimes you can not afford. Deep down I still have deep emotion for you, and the many trauma I went through and risked myself were and are pretty self destructive that I feel like I rather keep them in my safe box.  But still I am the one who end up saying more on my own terms as I am probably always bad at listening. But I miss you everytime anything resonates with me to realize how deeply I loved and cared about you, even though our expressions are very different.    I was watching this movie "The mountain between us" - it's about these one male and female who get stuck after a plane crush and eventually survive, they were both married when they got into that accident, but they came out of the situation falling in love with each other, but still when they came back to the real world from the wild, they could not just get together because they each had their past baggage to carry on, but eventually they get together again, because they truly had love for each other.. or may be the movie just wanted to produce a good ending. And may be, in real life, it's way more tragic. As I truly see my love story, the way we met, the way we conquered many obstacles, the way I blindly trusted you and the way we demised as the greatest tragedy of my life, even if no one cares. When I talked to my therapist who in a way saved me from wrecking myself, I described my state like a torn down island after a Tsunami, but I recognized that I have to rebuild again and I probably kind of did succeed in that, but definitely I did not feel at that moment that I will regain my courage to continue as I felt so little. I want to be your friend, I want to be in a place of strength where your thoughts and you no longer hurt me anymore, rather I can take you as one of the best friends who know certain parts of me more than anyone else. I am pretty sure we are both quite different person than who we were, may be in many ways unrecognizable. How do you truly feel about me when you think about me or us? Do you think you know me? But I know that I could not make you feel the way one wants to feel when one is in love and rather our love turned into boring chores and less exciting day by day and eventually it had to experience the death. And may be I took many things for granted that I shouldn't have and I have beaten myself for many years to find answers to what else I could have done. I have spent hours after hours feeling sad, and may be I still can not see the way you see and can move on just saying that it's the past we can learn from, because those hours of clouds and grief and depression will always have a reach at me. It's me who felt betrayed, even if I didn't necessarily need to feel that way.    But yeah, I or we just can not change the past. I also wish I could revert many things, I also want to say sorry for saying many things that's not true, for doing many things that only pushed each other away, even though I also only intended otherwise, only wanted to bond more. True, We can only learn from the past, but I'm truly afraid whether I will ever be able to bring anyone as close as I brought you inside my heart. It just breaks my heart when I think about how our love expired. But there's definitely thousand things I have to be grateful for the experiences we had. And the things I learnt from our relationship.   Like now, I'm lying down writing and thinking - We will just stay in two corners of the world knowing that we once loved each other. I know we can talk about some memories which are valuable to both of us. I even feel like if I could sit in front of you, I just won't have to say a single word. That itself is meaningful. I truly think love is not easy to find and I was lucky to have it when I was young. I  hope I can find love again and I wish the same for you, because love is beautiful and worth living for. Thank you for the beautiful moments of your life that you shared with me. I truly wanted to have it more, but may be it was just not meant to be. Well, the grief does have 5 stages: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptence. And you probably can not just simply decide timeline for your vary own stages of grief when you are flowing through time.

It's sometimes important to feel different. You try to do something that you never did before. It gives you the charm that you need to be energized. What's interesting if your every breathe is the same, your every steps look alike, your every look is that same old look, your every question is without any inquisitiveness? I am doing something new. I didn't plan to do it specifically today. But it came randomly to my mind. And i decided to do it. And i am feeling good and different. I am still in the process of doing it. I know I will be different when it finishes. I am not going to be a completely new me, but I will be something for few days that I never was. This thought of change gives me exhilaration and pleasure. I think I also should plan for a trip somewhere. Somewhere different. I will have to choose between a warm or a chilly place. I will buy a backpack and be an explorer for few days. It was a long time ago since I hiked mount Fuji. I should probably go to a place near the mountain where I will be able to hike too. I think I have never experienced camping in a forest. I will have to find out where I can do all these things all together. I need to plan to do something new. I need some different air to get back my curious eyes.

I want some positivity in my life. But everything that I do turn out to be negatively influencing me. I eat that makes me fat. I can't cook, i can't exercise, i can't study. It's really difficult for me at my current stage to concentrate to strenuous academic activities. I just feel lazy and keep myself engaged in unproductive work. I procrastinate and I suffer in return. I fail to strictly maintain my priorities. I feel to relieve myself from all my addictions in the morning but again find myself trapped and my whole day literally uneventful at the midnight. I'm too afraid of myself. I'm weak. I can't predict what next mistake is going to make me unhappy again. I just can't jump off my bed and start working. Interestingly I can still talk to people with high confidence and can hide all my worries. But again I'm not doing what I should. I'm in deep trouble. I don't really know whether I can find myself again. I'm lost. Totally lost.

I am struggling to maintain a good work schedule. I wanted to consistently work for at least 6 hours a day. Unfortunately this whole week was a total mess. As always, I got distracted by a lot of things. In fact I have introduced a new distraction in my life. I kind of became really overwhelmed with these. I got lucky, I found happiness and then I have been taken to the roof and thrown away and I was hurt again. I think I am acting really foolishly at this very important stage of my life. I have so much opportunity to learn and enjoy my life. But I am just fooling around. I have so many intellectual people around me and I am passing my days and nights completely out of touch with the reality. Why is it too hard to live simple? Why is too hard to just even breathe without thinking much? All these different desires, hopes and emotions just push me so much in so many ways that I just can't feel calm. After a while, if I stay alive, when I will look back to this period, how will I describe this mess of my life? I have no answer right now. I think I know why people should live, why people should be driven, why people should do good work and even why people do bad things. But I think I don't know why I should go forward. It's just this vacuum in my mind that is constantly seeking some sort of meaning or desiring to be loved or I don't know, fucking around being lazy. What's the solution of my situation- how can I be happy? If I work hard, if I do well in my courses, if I can publish some paper, that will bring happiness for sure. But when I don't feel the drive, how can I force myself towards all the work necessary to accomplish them. Is it just that you force yourself no matter what? Do I need to lose more to force myself? Like in a situation where I will have no money to drink, no money to buy food, like in absolute poverty. Is that when I will kick my ass and throw all my fantasies? Is that when my desire to love, fuck or wasting my time on utter shits will fly away? I just don't know myself. Why the hell I do things that I myself don't really want to do. Why do I waste time on silly things when I know how those are going to hurt me in the long run? Am I trying to control myself too much and eventually failing big? Is it just that I need to force myself to get back my habit of working my butt off? Yeah, that's what I need probably. Just work your butt off. Don't let your brain get excited in its pleasure centre. Kick yourself whenever it wants to do something other than work. Kick yourself, motherfucker.

I have so much interest in so many areas that a 24 hour day is often not enough. I sometimes feel like if I could skip sleeping and eating, that would be better. However, nature can't be unfair. I have been trying to find out strategies to have more productive days. I was setting a lot of rules. My bad habits seriously kill a lot of my precious time. I really feel regretful in some mornings when the last day wasn't passed the way I really intended. However, I need to push again and again. I used to believe in 8 keywords for success that I haven't been reminding myself for a long time. I just rewrote them again on my heart. Passion ---> Focus ---> Work ---> Persist ---> Ideas ---> Good ---> Push ---> Serve. To be successful, you need to be passionate about something. And you need to be focussed on that. You need to work hard for it too. And you need to be very persistent. You also need good Ideas. You should strive to be a good person. And as you will feel lazy, you will have to push yourself. And remember, you need to serve the people around in a society.

Title: Thoughts only drunken nights can bring

It's late Friday night now. I'm inside Harry's now. This is the closest bar from Purdue campus. I was actually at home watching movies few minutes ago. I watched two movies in a row. The first one was a thriller called "The Loft". It's a fucking psychopathic movie and plotted on fucking, cheating, killing, love, sex and accusing- the usual plots found almost all thrillers on earth. The second one is called "Don Jon". It's the second time I watched it. It's about obsession and how it can separate you from the real experience that you can have with real people. I loved the ending of the movie. Probably this movie is the reason why I'm in a bar now. Otherwise I probably would have watched another movie or something. At first I squared around the whole campus, was driving slowly, was trying slowly to breathe the air. I was probably expecting some cute girls walking outside on the street. But it's pretty cold out there and the girls inside the bars with their short dresses would have probably preferred to just keep themselves warm tonight. I then parked in the Chauncey square.. stretched my car seat and was thinking deep things lying down on my car seat. The air was pretty alcoholic there. Young undergrads were screaming because obviously they are out of their mind. I was thinking quite condescendingly that why people love to do all these craziness. It's probably nature of some human being to lose themselves in something crazy. Love, sex, adventure- all these things are probably just the strong urge of losing yourself. Even the things that we call sane are also bit crazy. Every genius out there basically needs to lose themselves in the things that they are passionate about. If you don't lose yourself, you can never enjoy anything. So, some of these 'losing yourself' we call good because they can go beyond yourself and bring some good for other people. And those are bad which are self centric and don't bring good not for you, not for others. But whatever it is, people just feel the strong urge to lose themselves to enjoy whether that bring good or not. Two dudes are dancing in front of me with some old music playing. And the girls with them are watching and clapping. Yeah.. men get this age old job of enchanting women.. However I was also thinking, in a city with young crazy minds, you can think why things need to be so crazier. But let's think we are in a small village in some other part of the world. Everybody is sleeping because you don't even have electricity. They are sleeping because nothing can happen in such rural place. They definitely sleep more than the dudes dancing in front of me. But if we want to measure happiness, how do we measure it? Is it the peace of mind or is it the excitement that you have define your happiness. Is it just subjective? Probably it is. You just need to find what makes you happy. And we all know that's fucking hard to find out. We are just confused.

I frankly don't know why I am doing what I am doing. I have this vast sea of unhappiness in me. I am swimming for hours, days, weeks, months and the sea seems to be never-ending. Sometimes I find something to hold and probably rest but then again I find myself swimming without sensing anything. Memories are so powerful, they can put you in so much pain and agony that you can barely feel yourself. I'm constantly bombarded by my emotional swings. I am so afraid, I'm so scared. I don't know how exactly I can get back my strength that used to drive me. I'm trying to build up good habits, I'm trying my best to avoid things that physically and emotionally can hurt me. But I'm still consumed by my depression. Tears come to my eyes, I feel to hit my head on walls, I feel to punch, I feel weak in my heart, I cry. Things are so not going well with me. And I am trying. I am probably doing better than how I was doing few weeks earlier. I know there is no quick path to get out of the mess I am in right now but I can't find enough energy to try all possible paths to escape that's needed. I was talking with my good old friend yesterday. We were talking about how it's possible to live life with all these sadness inside. People indeed have enormous amount of capability of handling things and move themselves forward. That just make me wonder why you then bring the mess in your life in the first place. Probably because there are so many things out of your control. And all the things your heart desired might not be worthy enough to pursue. I just constantly feel that I really don't deserve to fall in a situation like this. What did I do? Then again, when I see the miseries all over the world, I am probably lucky enough.  My fight is internal..

If I was free from everything, I would go to a small town where nobody knows me, where nobody rushes me, where I don't need to wake up in the morning with my bags of worries and responsibilities. I would walk along the road, I would breathe the fresh air, I would sit by the pond, I would wait for rainfall, I would make myself wet. And I would cry. Yesterday night I was at the lab very late. I had to stop for a drunk old man because he waved his hand to stop. Then I drove him up to his house. I felt good. But I was really tired. On monday, I cried a lot. My emotion just goes out of my control. I feel betrayed, I feel destroyed. I am thinking more and more about hurting myself. I talked with my therapist today. He gave me very good advice. He suggested me to live by my values. He said you will be unhappy and nobody can guarantee you happiness. But if you live by your values, evidence suggests that you will probably feel joy in the long run. I don't know when I can have my joy in my mind. I sometimes pass days without worries. But this constant chase just throws me into more meaninglessness sometimes. However, life is interesting and probably I should just learn.

Title: Halloween and Dead comet with skull face

Content:
Today is halloween. The morning started with a bit loneliness. I called my best friend and we talked about different things. I described him how my current research is going on over the DNA assembly algorithm comparative analysis, I talked with him about artificial intelligence, machine learning, supervised and unsupervised learning method and my natural language processing research. Interestingly when I explained to him about different ideas about learning theory, I gave him interesting analogies to make him understand better. I used the learning process of a human child inside a society with other grown up human being as the supervised learning method, on the other hand I gave him the example of a human baby growing up alone in a lonely island or a jungle and learning and distinguishing different physical objects and the reality as the unsupervised method of learning. We argued about evolution and I tried my best to make him grasp the vast amount of time required to have evolutionary changes. I think I have been relatively successful to change his misconceptions. Then he asked me whether it's possible to probabilistically predict the occurrence of accidents on the roads. I came up with the answer that if we well define different kind of accidents and we teach a machine learner about the causes and effects, it may be possible to predict accident zones and possible time of accidents and injury very precisely. After vigorous conversation with him, I  felt very well. Then I spent my whole day in Java Roaster- a calm, peaceful coffee shop in Lafayette and did study a little bit. Now I am in the lab trying to concentrate on my studies. But I am very tired. Listening to some music and writing this. There was a zombie stomp halloween party in the downtown. I could have gone but I didn't. I connected to lots of my friends today by sending them texts. But I wish I had a much more productive day in terms of homework completion. However.. I just read an article about the recent NASA discovery of a comet. This comet was initially misidentified as an asteroid and was named Asteroid 2015 TB145. But later they have correctly identified it as a comet. Interestingly it looks like a skull face. That's a great halloween discovery. It seems nature wants to play trick or treat with us by sending a skull face comet just before the halloween. You can see videos or read more about it on this phys.org article. I always wanted to talk about science, read and write about science. And for last two years, I have been thinking about having a science channel on youtube. I think I should start thinking about this project more. Happy halloween.

Title: Books that I have been reading

There are several books that I have been reading for quite long time. Some of them I have been reading for more than years. I don't know what is the best strategy: reading a single book with full attention and trying to finish it first or reading several books at the same time like I am doing. How did it happen that I got in touch with several writers at the same time. The reason is probably the fact that all of the books I have been reading are long non-fiction books that you can not finish very quickly. Some part of the book require more attention and multiple reading and need you to stop and think for a while. And in every book, there are some portion that you feel bored to read. I think sometimes those boring part just made me procrastinate finishing that book and persuaded me to move on to another topic. The books that I have been reading are "The Blank Slate" by steven Pinker, "The Procrastination Equation" by Piers Steel, "An Appetite For Wonder" by Richard Dawkins. Steven Pinker is one of the best contemporary scientist and writer whom I admire very much. In the blank slate, he argues against the idea that human mind is completely malleable. I have been fascinated by several chapters of that book but I think it will still require a great amount of time to finish that book. The book that I have been enjoying for last few weeks is the one about the biography of Richard Dawkins and how he became a renowned scientist. This book is really thrilling for me. As I want to become a scientist, I can relate my life to many different aspects mentioned in the book by Dawkins with his persuasive rhetorics. I have been reading the procrastination equation as I have a life long difficulty to finish work before the deadline. That book gave me a lot of insight. But I think I will have to finish reading it very carefully. Recently I have been feeling very lazy to read this book as it is not highly entertaining but really informative. Another audio book I have been listening is "The willpower instinct" which describes how we can develop our will power. I am happy that I am in the process of learning from all these books. I wish to read more books more often. The amount of time I spend by consuming videos from youtube, Netflix should be reduced down as most of the programs I watch, watched; even though give excitement, thrill, I should admit, don't necessarily make me a thoughtful person that I want to become.

Today was a nice sunny day. I absolutely loved the temperature. My morning was a bit rush. I had a summer internship interview over phone for which I have been preparing for several days. I wish I could give more concentration while preparing different coding questions. I am not very happy with my performance on some very basic questions. However, I got out of house during noon. I tried a new salad at Noodles Company and I totally loved it. They have some very good salad menu. Then Lori at Mastercut groomed my hair and I felt little bit awkward with my haircut which pretty much happen every time, on the very first day my hair is cut. Then I passed more than 2 hours of non-productive internet browsing at the starbucks. I should have studied at that time and progressed my homeworks. I am procrastinating again and I know I will suffer. Tomorrow I may go to bowl with some friends. Tomorrow's gonna be very busy. I have so many classes, then teaching and what not..

I am thinking about companionship. Why do we seek for companionship, why do we love interacting with other people? And why do we feel lonely when we don't have someone to accompany. Is it just the matter of engagement?  Engaging actively in conversation may actually help us get away from our own personal thoughts which are very often circular. If someone accompany us, do we feel ourselves somewhat special? Why is that human mind constantly seek for validation from others? It seems like you don't feel the existence of your ownself unless someone point a finger and say, "You know what you exist." It seems even being aware of this weakness can't always trick you not feel lonely. There are introverted people who probably don't feel this kind of urge for attachment. I wonder how their brain justifies or deals with an environment entirely with oneself.

Have you ever felt that you are standing far far away from the castle of love that you have built little by little, staring at it and feeling like you never ever go there because you are screamed to go away? And you are shouted to run away from it more and more so that you can delude yourself that it actually does not exist. You may find another castle of love which may capture you and give you what you want. But who knows such castle probably does not exist. Probably running on this desert and being chased to find the castle is what you are supposed to do before you concede and are ceased.

A heart, wide and broad, once thought that it will do something new. It asked the birds to lend two wings and started to fly and fly and then went above the clouds high. Then it  walked and walked on the clouds as if it was thinking. But it really wasn't , it was just walking. It was trying to feel the presence of everything, it was trying to not get lost in past, it was trying to breathe in the air as present as possible. It wanted to feel calm, it wanted to rest, it never looked down from where all the noise are coming from. It wanted to connect with something it never connected with. It resisted to dream, it resisted to get lost, it only wanted to feel the next step. It felt to scream but it didn't. It envied the clouds because of their freedom to vanish. It wants to vanish, it wants to resemble like a lot of things around.

Bernie Sanders. I like him. He seems to be the only politician in this country, who really understands what changes need to be brought to fix the mess American middle class family are suffering from. Look at his issue oriented camoaign: a ) His staunch position for making people aware of climate change due to irresponsible human activities. I have no clue how all the Republican candidates can deny the scientific consensus and still run for the most important position on earth and how so many people can also blindly support them. b) His opposition against wall street and desire to break the "too big to fail" banks. After the economic disaster and the controversial bail out, if anybody has read former managing director of Goldman Sachs and whistle-blower Nomi Prins, they can understand these banks are again constantly crucifying and bringing disaster for economy with their selfish greed and the strategy of quarterly profit maximization. c) Tuition free public college is a wonderful idea that has already been implemented by several countries. It's really nonsense to make profits from educational institutions the way it is currently operating around the country. Student debt has literally crushed so many students' lives. d) Campaign finance reform is his another political agenda. I think every sensible person knows that how super pacs and billionaire endorsements are influencing policies and how democracy is being threatened. I think Bernie, by avoiding super pac, has the highest credibility to effectively reform. e) He wants to raise the minimum wage to 15 dollar per hour which I think is a great idea to improve so many workers' lives and will definitely increase satisfaction. And in fact people will actually spend more which is also good for the economy. f) He wants to fight for women's right. In a civilized world like ours, we still have income inequality based on gender which is unacceptable. He wants to provide paid leave which I have no idea why we already don't have. How on earth, a parent can leave their new borns to work.  LGBT community right is also important that he wants to focus on. g) Institutional racism is another big issue. Initially Bernie was looking at the race issue with the lens of income inequality issues and employment opportunity imbalances. But I think now he is strategically reaching towards different race groups and expressing his earnest desire for change. He was part of civil right movements and I totally believe that he will really bring real changes. If Bernie wins 2016 election and can really gather people for a revolution to change against all oppositions, it will really be a great achievement for contemporary human history. I am gladly waiting to see the next 9 years how america goes through the changes under President Bernie. If what he is promising can be achieved, that will bring hope to lots of countries where political changes are really required. Let's hope for a better future.

It's never tiring to explore new things. All you need is to change your perspective, widen your horizon, reach outwards, toss out your fear for unknowns. Inquiring into the unknown may be daunting, but the effort you make always brings the fruit. It sometimes is tremendously hard to leave the shoes that you were wearing for long long time. There is no doubt that you have legitimate reasons to keep your old shoes on and try to keep yourself in your comfort zone. But the truth is none of your comfort zones are really perpetual which can accommodate you forever safely. It takes mere hours to lose your seemingly unassailable habitat that you might have built for years. There is no lack of catastrophe in this beautiful but dangerous world. The more you are reluctant to increase the breadth of your life, the more you are prone to make yourself vulnerable. It takes quite a bit of learning how you truly reach even to the person you meet everyday, how you open your mind to different possibilities. It may be our cognitive deficiency that we feel scared when we are uncertain. But look around, does anything look certain to you? Then this constant desire for certainty is probably the wrong way of approaching towards life. Preparation for uncertainty has its fundamental requirement of challenging your ideas and being persuasive enough to experience everything that is obscure. Learning how to navigate through the whirling winds in your life require courage and you can garner the raw materials that give birth to an intrepid heart by being adventurous. Have you noticed in the phenomenal Tom & Jerry cartoon where Tom sometimes is running desperately and then cross the edge of a high place and run on literally nothing underneath his feet? But interestingly he doesn't fall until he looks downward and suddenly finds no ground beneath his feet. I think first of all you try to avoid crossing an edge unless you are pushed enough and secondly even if you decide to cross, you should not look down. You need to learn to obtain the skill of retaining your valor to deal the unusual. You may gain some invisible force that will allow you to cross if you don't let your mind be boggled by the vacuum. Because there will soon be something to fill you and let you fly. You may not have some real wings but you can definitely grow some temporary ones and enter into the synthetic reality to navigate the gloomy verisimilitude. I know we get tired when we see everything worth gaining is expensive and demand a great deal of effort. It's not that we don't try but we get tired and alarmed due to the failures we experience. Sometimes it feels like everything around is structured to diminish your spirit but that's the pessimism spiral you should try to get out of. It takes time to be inspired, it takes positive events to occur in all the negative randomness we are submerged with. But hope it is and dream it is that should keep us alive and I am not frightened to dare the darkness. Are you?

There she was ruminating, pondering.. That coffee shop corner now luminous and bright With her pulchritude and elegance; Two inquisitive eyes running through those pages.. Desiring to dare exploring the curves of her mind? Whether it's flying away from snowy numbness outside, Charming could be a journey as conscious as possible.. With her effervescent smile sparkling around. Perfect match are those painting and books behind her Her blond hair seems like an intersection of dream and reality As expressive she is with her waving hands when she speaks And her touching of her nose, lips & ears when she listens. A living embodiment of vitality she was.. Now she left and is lost in the crowds. -- A poem inspired by a girl in a coffee shop. "Poetry is just the evidence of life.

I am happy that I have accomplished something on the Christmas day. At last I could finish the memoir "An Appetite For Wonder - The Making of a Scientist" of my favorite scientist Richard Dawkins. It was such an inspiring read, especially at a time when I am suffering a lot academically and lacking a lot of enthusiasm. The first part of the book was about his childhood in africa. He had truly amazing naturalist parents. The book has very interesting description about the schools he went. His education at Oxford has had a great influence on him. The whole book has transformed him leading to a science career where he unveiled some complex ideas through his own unique style of communication. His marvelous way of seeking answers through well posed questions is really really enthusiastic. Thanks Richard. Will wait for the second part.

I have this fear of being lonely. I just don't want to be lonely. I always want to have some people around me talking, laughing or making jokes. But I have actually tried a number of times to keep myself disconnected. But too much isolation never helps me a lot, it just reduces my confidence to live every day productively. Productivity was something I always cared about till recently. My past few months were really unproductive. I've never been stuck with myself before. I'm now frustrated with my daily performance. I'm having issues with working long hours, giving full concentration to something that I even like. However, there were so many external factors that blew me away. I think I am very weak against rejection. Probably most of the people are like that. Some rejections can be really hard to put aside. But any motivated hard working person needs to be resilient against rejection. I have apparently lost my resilience. I am trying to hold few things that I need to let go forever. I need some miracle.

There are some times when you don't know what to do. You may know what you should do, you may know what you should avoid doing, but you don't know what you really want. You have choices from both extremes that pull each other from both ends and you just can't stay calm with a firm resolution. You know what you are going to lose with either choice you make. But you just don't want to lose anything and this aversion just put you in a perpetual confusion state. It's so hard to find a balanced middle ground sometimes that really boggle the mind. I don't know whether it can be called a greedy state of mind when you want to hold everything you deeply care about. Sometimes the thing that you want so much and even when you think that you truly deserve to have it, there happens to come more obstacle in getting to reach that thing. At some point, you want to give up but then the emotions attached to all your efforts can't help you let leave from the desire of acquiring that thing. This constant self-conflict can be tremendously hard to break out from. It's scary how circularly you can revolve round and round the same black sphere which gradually sucks out all of your energy.

I am thinking about life. I am thinking about what is important in life. Everyone judges everything based on his or her personal experience. In fact most people tend to judge the most significant issues without fact checking, without understanding lots of backgrounds. You talk, you promote as you view the world. But your view of the world is quite biased by the way you have been brought up, by the experiences you have had throughout your life. I see lack of empathy everywhere and wonder how people can or should be encouraged to be empathetic. I am now living in an individualistic culture of america where most people, at least educated people whom I see around me, are focussed in progressing in their very own life. It's true that if everyone is doing the right thing for his or her own self, ultimately as a whole it's going to be good for a community, more broadly for a society. In an ideal place where everyone is capable of taking care of himself or herself, do we still need a lot of empathy? If I check the meaning of the word empathy, google shows "the ability to understand and share the feelings of another". So, given that we live in a society, and most of the social service and business is modeled on a producer-consumer idea, given that a healthy life requires a lot of interaction between people, it seems to me empathy is always needed. But do we really try to understand and share the feelings of another? If I argue that understanding the situation or feeling of others help you to not trouble or bug yourself by the constant flow of the small annoyances in life, probably that won't be incorrect. If you are suffering, it always helps if you look outside your own suffering and try to realize that you are not the only one and stop blaming everyone. We always try to justify our own acts whether it's good or bad as if we can not or should not do any mistakes. A life now in a highly paced culture, we are often so hectic that we can't even feel what's going on. And in the end of each day, it seems like that's not the way the day you wanted to pass.

This cloudy afternoon.. All the dreams are hanging from the clouds. And all your attentions into that screen, Don't really surprise me. As we are all disconnected in our individual island. If it were a rainy day, I would probably say you hello, Or would offer you a hot cocoa. You might ask "Why didn't you do it today when you are feeling dreamy?" Because rainy is romantic for me to feel the wet breeze and smell. And gently feel the warmth and radiation from someone. Cloudy and sunny is to smile and be unusual, And moving like crazy and feeling the heart. Vivacious outside is calling me. Great it would be if someone like you were with me today, But it's all dreams you know, For some ravishing smile and glow.

A certain kind of blissful pride  was there In the corner of your lips. And a blend of firm determination and sweet innocence In your deep blue eyes. I love to take snapshots.. Snapshot of real beautiful moments; Like what I glimpsed when you were before my eyes. It's mind-blowing that you uncovered my poetic me In this early morning. The wide sunny sky outside wasn't enough to push me.. It took you and your busy beautiful face that drove me.. I'm stranger to you.. but whatever, It feels good to me to write some lines for you And something also for you to read and giggle.

Title: An awakened heart

Content:
So many promises made that got broke. Alas! Each break up drowns, dissuades against to explore and probe. A heart mistakenly starts walking through the narrow corridors; And it mindlessly mops all those messy memory floors. Continuity is hard to obtain and thus crying out in dismay That fake almighty is absolutely  nowhere  to pray. Emotion wants to submerge when trying to run away So many fears, disgust and angst that a heart needs to allay. When a heart finds its own desire to be the reason to wreck itself; Sickening and nauseating it becomes by hating its own self. Still when the sun shines, the wind blows and the moon glows It feels to straighten its eyebrow and jump and it throws and grows.

Permanent happiness is for sure an illusion. By little introspection, one can easily find out that one can not be permanently happy. Because one's experience itself is pretty dynamic constantly influenced by the natural world outside, the emotional world inside and the superabundant interactions between these two. If the ultimate goal of one is to achieve an optimal state of happiness in the most possible conscious moments of one's life, then from the very start of that continuous journey, one needs to prepare oneself for the rocky unhappy moments. But there are always some surprising unhappy moments one can not be prepared for and in fact, a life where everything is predictable is probably a very boring life to lead with few diversities and excitements at all. Then it follows that one's experience of unhappiness, distress and melancholy is inevitable for one's own happiness. One may argue that happiness and unhappiness are two sides of a coin being flipped randomly and incessantly. One, as an experiencer, is just a part of the coin flip reality with one's desperate desire to achieve the happy side every time but evidently no prior ability to force the coin. Does then being a vigilant who prepares for future shock tend to achieve more happiness than a carefree? In general, our education claims to teach to prepare us so that we can be better equipped to deal with the uncertainties brought to us each day. Desire to get a good job, desire to acquire a good mate, desire to have stability in one's inner mind and the desire for peace in society - all are to bring more happiness around. But one can never avoid being unhappy is what my personal realization at this moment.

Title: A lonely afternoon after nightmares

Content:
I am learning. It feels like I am starting a new life. Or may be I am learning to look differently. Because I need to bury so much. It's hard to stop remembering the things that was so integral to me. So, I am trying to learn to live with them in a way so that they don't crush my skull. But it's truly a roller coaster ride. It's heartbreaking as the good memories that used to bring smile to my face, used to relieve me when I had hard times, those same golden memories are what isolate me so much and take away all positive energy that I used to have. It's so difficult sometimes to force yourself just to be okay. I never liked to be the cry baby, a whining person who can't get out of a bad situation. But I do cry a lot now, mostly unintentionally. Every morning I wake up and assure myself that I will have a happy ending when I will get back to the bed. But it barely happens. I try to make friends, I try to talk to random people, I try to listen to the songs. But the string that got detached doesn't seem to get back to its right spot again. I wish I didn't have desires. I wish I could be someone who can be happy with what little I have. Sometimes I try false satisfaction thinking the best of the worst. I tell this to me. I tell myself that I should be happy. I tell myself that it's me who can bring the joy to me. I tell myself that my happiness, my wellbeing should not depend on anyone else who don't care me. It sometime helps, but sometimes it doesn't. I know I need to continue doing it. I feel to have sex, I see beauty, I feel craving, then I feel guilty, I feel guilty of I don't know what. May be I feel guilty of ruining my moments. I know I am confused. Some day I am energized, I am full of life, I jump, I play. Some day I am numb, out of energy, out of reality. I know I am letting all my emotions take over myself and I should not do that. But this constant forcing your own self makes me more weaker and weaker. I wish I could be naturally happy and a fighter who is not afraid of life. Yes, I am afraid of life now. Because this physical self that I have it has so many desires, cravings that distract and contradict my inner self. There's no harmony that I find between the two selves I have. I know I am not alone who is heartbroken. I know I could have more miseries and sorrows than what I have. But nothing makes me as stronger as I used to be. I just can't see a beautiful future. Because I had a different future in my mind. I feel like I don't have the courage and power to reconstruct another future. I thought about the solution which is not to think about future, just to live in my present. It seems impossible to not get lost in my past and future. I know what I should, but that's not what I want. But I know I need to be rational at best. Last night I wrote my suicide note. I wrote my suicide note several times. But I still love life, there's still part of me which didn't lose hope, which wants to see the sun rise and sun set. I hope I never have the courage to seize myself like I fantasize. Don't know how many people have experienced the fantasy of suicide. Hope that day never comes when I will really do it. I should fight right! Fight like a beast.

Title: Some thoughts with Žižek

Categories & Tags: philosophy, Quotes
Content:
I am thinking; thinking about love; thinking about living happy; thinking about what matters; thinking about the physical bounds, the emotional bounds; thinking about creating something; thinking about meaning; thinking about understanding; thinking about reconciliation; thinking about peace; thinking about judgment; thinking about commitment; thinking about sacrifice; thinking about compromise; thinking about relativity; thinking about selfishness; thinking about self-centeredness; thinking about opportunism; thinking about gratification; thinking about patience; thinking about moral, ethical senses; thinking about biological defense; thinking about aggression; thinking about violence; thinking about foolishness; thinking about rhythm; thinking about resonance; thinking about susceptibility; thinking about vulnerability; thinking about hopelessness; thinking about helplessness; thinking about power; thinking about self-worth; thinking about alternation; thinking about the edge of the precipice; thinking about adventure; I am thinking. All these thoughts just appear. Not always I can pin point the initiation of my every thought. They appear, they make me feel and then they disappear. Some give me joy, some make me feel trapped, some stupefy me, some disturb me, upset me, some make me feel calm, some make me feel loved, some make me desire, some make me wish, some make me hope, some throw me in to water, some make me aggressive, some make me active, some make me passive. This moment is what I got, may be expected but may not be desired, may be desired but may not be expected, along with this infinite spectrum of remembered or forgotten past and this infinite spectrum of future and its uncertainty. Realizing the existence and the desire to move to the next moment is ingrained that I feel and what most of activities sum up to is that we just push ourselves to a new future by acting with the present with whatever emotion we are being eclipsed with. Anyway.. I am reading some quotes from Slavoj Zizek. The works of Slavoj Žižek can advance the field of emotional geographies, as well as our understandings of emotion, space, and society. Žižek provides a rich social theoretical vocabulary that can help explain cultural discontent, how emotional worlds bond and fall apart, why there is no guaranteed harmony in love with our partner, and how emotional worlds are organized in ways so that people can hold onto something that resembles ‘subjectivity’ and ‘reality’. [ref] “The one measure of true love is: you can insult the other” -- that is true but do we really understand the inner meaning of what he is suggesting. “Words are never 'only words'; they matter because they define the contours of what we can do.” -- Yes, and we fail again and again to use the words appropriately. Ahh “We feel free because we lack the very language to articulate our unfreedom.” -- We are in deed not free. “The problem for us is not are our desires satisfied or not. The problem is how do we know what we desire.”  -- this one really boggled me. “Love feels like a great misfortune, a monstrous parasite, a permanent state of emergency that ruins all small pleasures.” -- nothing I can add. “[T]his readiness to assume the guilt for the threats to our environment is deceptively reassuring: We like to be guilty since, if we are guilty, it all depends on us. We pull the strings of the catastrophe, so we can also save ourselves simply by changing our lives. What is really hard for us (at least in the West) to accept is that we are reduced to the role of a passive observer who sits and watches what our fate will be. To avoid this impotence, we engage in frantic, obsessive activities. We recycle old paper, we buy organic food, we install long-lasting light bulbs—whatever—just so we can be sure that we are doing something. We make our individual contribution like the soccer fan who supports his team in front of a TV screen at home, shouting and jumping from his seat, in the belief that this will somehow influence the game's outcome.” “Liberal attitudes towards the other are characterized both by respect for otherness, openness to it, and an obsessive fear of harassment. In short, the other is welcomed insofar as its presence is not intrusive, insofar as it is not really the other. Tolerance thus coincides with its opposite. My duty to be tolerant towards the other effectively means that I should not get too close to him or her, not intrude into his space—in short, that I should respect his intolerance towards my over-proximity. This is increasingly emerging as the central human right of advanced capitalist society: the right not to be ‘harassed’, that is, to be kept at a safe distance from others.” “Yeah, because I'm extremely romantic here. You know what is my fear? This postmodern, permissive, pragmatic etiquette towards sex. It's horrible. They claim sex is healthy; it's good for the heart, for blood circulation, it relaxes you. They even go into how kissing is also good because it develops the muscles here – this is horrible, my God! It's no longer that absolute passion. I like this idea of sex as part of love, you know: 'I'm ready to sell my mother into slavery just to fuck you for ever.' There is something nice, transcendent, about it. I remain incurably romantic.” “Do not blame people and their attitudes: the problem is not corruption or greed, the problem is the system that pushes you to be corrupt." -- May be we love to detest. “Come on. I don't have any problem violating my own insights in practice.” “Beyond the fiction of reality, there is the reality of the fiction.” “Our biological body itself is a form of hardware that needs re-programming through tantra like a new spiritual software which can release or unblock its potential.” “I agree with Sophocles: the greatest luck is not to have been born - but, as the joke goes on, very few people succeed in it.” “While just looking, we are always hunting among objects, looking for what we desire or fear, endeavoring to recognize some pattern; on the other hand, objects themselves always "stare back," vie for our attention, throw at us their lures and endeavor to entrap us.” “I secretly think reality exists so we can speculate about it.” ― Slavoj Žižek

After I woke up in the morning, I took a walk in my campus. It was beautiful, mild. I loved the birds chirping. It brought smile to my lips. I looked at the grasses. They made me feel soft. I felt the shower of sunlight. I looked at the beautiful blue sky. I didn't see a lot of clouds. It was rainy and gloomy yesterday. I liked the change. I liked that everything around me is lively and lovely. I walked through the blocks of buildings, my department, then the fraternity, sorority houses, then the starbucks where I sometimes study, then the recreational center, then the parking lot where I parked my car. Then I moved my car, I was listening to some songs being played in the radio. I was feeling happy seeing people walking by the roads, couples holding each other's hands. I tried to think about what are the things to be done today. I am planning to be productive, to do something fun, to submerge myself in studies.

Title: VSauce &amp; the speed of light &amp; relativity
Published Date: Sat, 21 May 2016 16:20:27 +0000

Content:
I have great admiration for Michael. He does amazing job in explaining quite interesting and often complicated ideas in his VSauce youtube videos. I like how he explains things, how he raises his voice and slows down and puts emphasis and sometimes surprises. He picks topics that's interesting. Every time, he gives me some new insight even on topics I believed I already knew enough. Guess what, there's no end of knowing! His way of expressing has some magic that kind of lightens me up. And no doubt a lot others feel the same way as he is probably the most famous youtube science video makers. Today I watched his video called "Would Headlights Work at Light Speed?" where he explained how when the speed of light increases, time slows down. If there were a stationary spaceship and a moving spaceship both sending light forward, as you can see in the video, no one light beam can get past the other one. It just shows that light has constant speed everywhere for everything. It can be understood from a very simple equation that everybody learns in their junior school physics class which is distance = velocity   x  time or,                     time = distance  /  velocity As you can see, here the velocity is the velocity of light (c =  2.9979 × 1010 centimeters per second) which is constant. So, for the moving ship the travelled distance is smaller. So, then the value of time needs to be smaller too as the light speed needs to be constant. On the other hand, for the stationary ship, the distance is larger, therefore, the value of time needs to be larger too. That means, an observer in the stationary ship has measured more distance in more time, for him more time has passed. But for an observer in the moving ship has measured less distance, for him less time has elapsed relative to the observer in the stationary ship. Isn't that mind bogglingly awesome? The more the velocity of the moving ship gets closer to the speed of light, the shorter the spanned time will be for the observer inside it. If the moving ship can reach the speed of light which is practically impossible for a vehicle with mass, the elapsed time will be zero as light can not get out of the moving ship and the distance in the above equation is zero but the moving ship is moving forever right. But on the other hand, the time is eternally passing by for the observer in the stationary ship. It's like not a single micro-micro-micro--- second has passed for the observer in the moving ship where as forever has passed for the observer in the stationary ship. So, the time we pass is basically relative to how we measure it with respect to the speed of light. Awesome, right. I wonder if we could simulate time dilation in our mental world some day.  Thanks VSauce for letting me think about the theory of relativity after a while again.

It's summer. I wish I can turn into a butterfly now. I wish I can fly and harness the wild natural beauty and soothe my mind. I am looking for hiking opportunity to some new mountains or trails. I hope there are plenty to explore near the midwest where I am located. I was searching about the popular hiking spots around here. Midwest, even though it has erratic weather pattern, is blessed with the seasonal changes which allow to enjoy winter, summer and spring. There are places, national parks full of beautiful trees, rivers, creeks, bridges and every place has its own inherent beauty to explore. It's been a while I haven't got closer to a waterfall. It wouldn't be a bad idea to get wet with some waterfall water. Nature is calling me. I should pack my backpack and have a camera to make the journey to the heart of nature. (1) Martinsville, Indiana: Tecumseh Trail I may encounter lizards, turtles and deer; wild berries and mushrooms. I think I will enjoy the Yellowwood Lake. (2) Eagan, Minnesota: Lebanon Hills Regional Park Lakes, light woods, marshes and meadows near the twin cities. (3) Ponca, Nebraska: Ponca State Park Timber, open prairie and the banks of the Missouri River. I think I can enjoy the grassy, wide paths. (4) Utica, Illinois: Matthiessen State Park I should not miss the wooden boardwalks, bridges and stairs in north-central Illinois ridges and through fragrant cedar groves on the Upper Dells trails. (5) Garretson, South Dakota: Palisades State Park To enjoy Split Rock Creek, which carved 50-foot bluffs and rugged formations from large deposits of rosy Sioux quartzite. Filled with short but challenging trails. (6) Loudonville, Ohio: Mohican State Park Interconnected trails around the Clear Fork of the Mohican River. There are a covered bridge and two waterfalls and a climbable fire tower to explore. (7) Mcgregor, Iowa: Pikes Peak State Park A wooden boardwalk that I should not miss. This offers a forest of hardwoods and large ferns lines and lovely waterfalls through these hills by the Mississippi. (8) Marquette, Kansas: Kanopolis State Park Blessed with sandstone canyons and bluffs in central Kansas. It starts on the Buffalo Track Canyon Nature Trail at Trailhead C, and follow it 0.75 miles through a flower-filled meadow, where the Horsethief Canyon Trail begins. It's a 5.5-mile hike. I can enjoy Buffalo Creek, pass caves and climb over sandstone slabs. (9) Ste. Genevieve, Missouri: Hawn State Park An easy hike under 2 miles round-trip. Pickle Creek Trail,  4-mile White Oaks Trail, wildflower meadows and more. Cool! (10) Mesick, Michigan: Huron-Manistee National Forests Manistee River Trail with all its white pine stands, giant ferns. It would be awesome to pass through the suspension bridge across the Manistee River. (11) Wisconsin: Ice Age National Scenic Trail 1,000 forested trail miles trace the edge of the last continental glacier across the state. No wonder.. it's ice age trail. (12)Lisbon, North Dakota: Sheyenne River State Forest This is a 4.5-mile round-trip with Mineral Springs and Waterfall Trail packs. Things to enjoy are bridges over streams and the Sheyenne River Valley and the waterfall. So, let's hike and be part of nature. Reference

Quick Summary of Hegelian Views: Important part of ourselves can be found in parts of history. Ancient Greece for example. Learn from ideas you dislike. Learn the alien points of views. What is hiding there? What underlying good idea is there? To identify .. Progress is messy. Overcompensating the previous mistake is tough. The German philosopher Hegel believed that strange and alien bits of history have much to teach us. He believed story and civilization do not move in a straight line, so important ideas and attitudes get left behind. Art has a purpose. Art is the sensuous presentation of idea. Take good, already known ideas and stick them into our mind creatively.

It was a great experience to walk by the river Naperville. I knew about a hiking trail there from a Facebook group event. However, eventually, I did it by myself. It was a rainy saturday morning when I left home in West Lafayette. Then I drove two hours to the small cute Naperville town. I asked few people about where to start walking and they were kind enough to show me. It was really green, calm and serene. I loved the sound of the water and started walking. There were several bridges across the river. The river walk starts from the Washington street and then ends in Jefferson street. There is an awesome tall wind chime in between which creates wonderful sound. I also recorded the wind chime sound for few minutes. I was not the only person taking a nice walk by the river. There were some other couples and runners who accompanied me. I also liked the Naperville downtown. It is very neat and I was amazed by a number of street paint works. After my walk, I had my lunch in a cafe near the Washington street. Then I went to Chicago. I will post some of my Chicago experience in the next post.

This saturday, I wasn't sure whether I will explore Chicago too. As I was near Chicago and haven't experienced the Chicago air for almost a year, I didn't want to miss the opportunity. When I was in Naperville, I was trying to convince some friends to come with me to Chicago. But then I decided to come by myself. I searched whether there are some events going on this saturday. And as usual Chicago doesn't disappoint you if it comes to events. There was a free music festival going on from last friday in Millennium park right near the cloud gate. Actually I was hesitant about going to Chicago after hiking in Naperville as I was really tired. But when I knew about this event and my past experiences in millennium park were always good, then I decided to push myself. Anyway, I absolutely loved walking through the neat streets of Chicago. I stopped in a starbucks coffee shop and took a cup of coffee. Then when I was near the millennium park, I could already hear the music. The gospel music festival was being held and the performers/singers were entertaining the crowds. Though I am not a big fan of religious music, I just liked the atmosphere. I loved watching children playing around, couples holding their hands kissing each other. It was welcoming, it was refreshing. I was sitting on the green grass and listening to the singers and watching people taking photos in front of the cloud gate. And I reminded her, us, our memories from last last winter when we came and took some pictures. I became nostalgic, sad. I started walking, went to a subway. The mexican server Anthony was really friendly. When I finished eating, I found Anthony outside smoking. Then he shared a cigarette with me and we talked. We talked about Chicago, about life a bit. It was fun. I was really tired and it was hard for me to keep focus while driving back to home. And I slept. I was really tired but satisfied and happy.

This is exactly what I am feeling right now. Fear. Extreme fear which is pushing me towards a hole. Now I am writing. But interestingly, I am feeling it hard to express what I am feeling inside. I was thinking, being worried, anxious for hours. Now I can't put those feelings into words. What's wrong? Why is my mind so scattered right now? Why is it hard to feel right? I am confused by all the different choice that I have every moment. I am confused about setting the right priorities every moment. My mind always tries to escape, tries to escape from the reality I am in, tries to forget the situations I need to overcome. I have been told several times by several people that I just can't chill and I am too intense. And my response was that I am cool with that. Not everyone needs to be chill. Not everyone has gone through the experiences I have gone through. Not everyone feels like I feel when I wake up, when I am in a dark room feeling lonely and helpless. I know I am not alone. I know these feelings are real. I can think rationally and logically and push them away, but they again come back whenever I am weak. Feeling strong and confident is sometimes so difficult. This fear of failure- I know its origin but still I can't prevent feeling it. You feel afraid only when you have something to lose. It may be your life, it may be something precious that you want to hold, it may be yourself. I know I fear myself, because I can't control myself, because I can't control my feelings all the time. May be there's no one who can control themselves all the time. May be the concept of trying to control yourself is a misleading one. What I mean is that I do things that I hate later on, I set priorities incorrectly that I feel ashamed of. I know why I fail every time, but even though I hate to fail, even though I feel the pressure. I was reading about stoicism, about feeling indifferent, thinking about the worst case scenario and just be okay. May be I am too intense. But do I really want to be so intense? It's just that who I am? I know I need to change. But was I not failing to change again and again. I make progress but then I slip in the slippery slope again. What to fear actually? - that's exactly what I tell myself. What to lose? - that's exactly what I ask myself. But still I feel fear, feel like a loser. Am I sore loser? May be I am. I aim high, then I can't maintain, then I feel the fear. May be it's a cycle. Should I be then not aiming high? I know I am not doing all these correctly. But why? What did I learn from all the mistakes I have made? I feel like I haven't learnt anything, I am in a cycle.. doing same mistakes again and again. Yes, that's what it is.. The feeling that I have right now is also a repeated feelings. May be the situation is different, but similar. I just put myself in a same kind of shitty situation. It just has a different mask but still the same, so the fear is again the same, so the solution may also be the same, or may be there's no solution but to wait these feelings to go away. But again these will come back. And again I will fear to close my eyes.

I em enjoying this walk. This walk is different again. I am feeling the charm to explore. I am receiving and I am realizing the beauty of everything that has some life. I just read a quote that "There is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way." It sounded very true to me. I was thinking for long time yesterday about what I want from life. The answer that I got over and over is that I want to be healthy and happy. But this is not that simple as it seems. Because it requires effort. Sometimes a great deal of effort and awareness.

It's an identity created by all the neural connectivity the brain experiences over time with the physical body participating in all the real events it had in its scope in its lifetime. If the physical self wouldn't experience certain things, wouldn't have participated in specific life events, the experiences of the brain would be different and so is the ego and so is the self. So, I, as a whole, is just one of the billions of others I could have become. But I am too attached to my own identity. Everyone is. And one can argue that for the style of life in a communal society, you don't have much choice. If everyday when you wake up, you could start a new you wanting to erase all the past you, you wouldn't be accepted. Not that you need to care! But.. again.. If you wear costume and change your outlook every morning so that no one can identify you, then you don't exist in the eyes of others. But you do exist. But the problem is you start questioning your own existence. Because you are confused with multiple identities in yourself and so the others around you give you the perspective about what you mostly are. At least in general sense. I am not saying that it's not possible to identify yourself without other human minds and their opinions. You may not need another human being, but you need this world, the air, the sky where you are contained to feel your existence. That means you understand yourself from an external towards an internal process, not an internal towards an external process. I will argue the later is almost impossible. Let me elucidate - When you are sleeping at night, if you are not dreaming or at least if you don't recall dreaming, you are breathing, everything outside you is still going on, somebody is drinking, somebody is writing song or poetry, somebody is fucking hard or moaning or screaming, somebody is crying, somebody is laughing his ass off, somebody is just looking at the night sky, but you are not experiencing those, you are just not a part of those stories, so those don't add anything to yourself, for you those are unreal, so your reality is only constructed when you are conscious about what's going on. That's why you can not feel your existence when you are unaware. That means all these going on surrounding you give you the perspective of your own existence. Anyway, I digress. Realizing that everything is relative can help us not to attach too much to certain things. Pain, dissatisfaction can be very hard to deal with. It's because we feel extreme attachment with those memories. We feel like our selves have been wounded, damaged by those experiences, by those failures. Joy, satisfaction are also similar. One can argue that if you don't have such attachment, then you will feel neither joy nor sadness. And that's entirely true. You need some attachment to feel. I never said that the illusion is not important. The illusion is important for you to feel, for you to be a human being. But you don't need to disagree with the fact that it's an illusion. You, again, just sometimes need to realize that these are illusion. At least it helps when you are crippled with something inside your mind and sometimes when your own self, your own ego hurts you. And may be when you are against your self. You may question - then what's the point? Where is the value of yourself? What's the purpose? I don't know the most philosophically accepted answer. But for me, you need those for you to continue, for you to be a productive member of your community. You just need to keep going till you expire. So, you can come up with your own answers. You can take answers from those who pondered a lot on those. Or you can be totally oblivious about all these questions and keep on living, eating, shitting and fucking and if you are smart, making some contribution so that others can keep on doing those a little bit longer than they would if you wouldn't give a shit. Well, is this a pessimistic view about life? May be it is! I could do some euphemism and could come up with some optimistic one. That I often do. Optimism sometimes helps, pessimism sometimes helps. Hey! You need both calmness and anger. All you need just to go on. May be some options are better because they are less chaotic. But this time, let it be this way. If your surrounding, whatever achievements, whatsoever human connections, your religion, your ideology  can answer your questions, help you to keep walking and persevering, then have them. But some are false, some are half false, some are true and you should not burden with your realization on someone else. And importantly again, realize that it's all illusion and keep on acting.

Title: Was trying to examine the interrelationship of luck and success

You need to be extremely lucky. Definitely your success should be attributed to your own hard work and effort. You definitely earned your own success but there's a lot of luck involved in your being there to be able to put some effort and then be successful. The only credit you may take is probably that you have utilized your circumstance in every bit possible. There are a lot of people who had the luck, who were equipped like you in all possible ways to produce the success but they didn't and you are not one of them. You were different. You were a hard working individual and you managed against every tide to reach where you wanted to be fit the most. However, on the other hand, there are people who knows magic, who can overcome almost everything no matter how big the hurdle is, no matter how negative everything goes against their desired path. But I think these kind of people are gifted. What I mean by gifted is that they are born with or they were trained to have such resilience and be fantastic. But when we use the word gifted or genius, it basically means that the factors that contribute to their awesomeness are hard to measure or difficult to grasp and thus are not easily be experimented on others to get some algorithm to produce more gifteds' or genius'. So, they are rare, their way of working should sometimes be taken as some sort of ideal way, they should be the inspiration, but they are not the norm. And I am talking about the norm because that's where you can try to generalize. We are basically advised to follow some formula; eating in a healthy way, entertaining in a healthy way, planning in a careful way, studying in a smart way, working in some efficient way etc. etc. And these just lead you through some known successful paths. However, these healthy, careful, smart, efficient ways are not that easy to follow for everyone. That's where I am talking about luck. First of all, you need to know all these ways in the first place and then try and then be successful. The genius, the gifted, who are now out of context, has the unique ability to figure them out by himself or herself. But for a normal person, they need to be taught, they need to be shown. And that's why these formula are not in everyone's hand. However, in these days of internet, there is some light. But the chaotic internet can confuse you even more and can make you more dull. Anyway, that means, you somewhat need to be in the right place, with the right parents, with the right friends, in the right institution to gain the access to those known ideas, to be exposed to those known success and to be inspired. As we all know, a human can only perform and outsmart his limitation when he is confident enough. But to have that confidence, you get to be lucky, that's what I am saying. So, then, what I am suggesting? That failure is inevitable, there's no wonder why so many people are suffering, it's easy to see why everywhere you can see unhealthiness even though good things are already understood, why there is poverty. Already wealth distribution is a big problem, in fact it was a problem in most of our human history, powerful people are greedy and they will just want to control each and everything, even though some society, some revolutionaries tried to change it with some success, but we are back in to that same greedy mechanics again. On top of that, what I am suggesting is the knowledge distribution. Information and knowledge are also not distributed properly. These two inequalities are not unrelated. In fact they are very related. Now I understand some of the visionaries who wanted to spread education, who wanted to spread information. May be they understood that this world can only progress when more people have access. But anyway, still there's extreme luck involved. So, sometimes we should not be too harsh to ourselves when things are out of place.

Title: Music, Hippy &amp; Spirituality

I find music as something that can give some bliss, satisfy me. It definitely depends on what you listen and how you let music touch your heart. But there's always a kind of music that can fit with your mood. There are so many amazing talents in the world of music who want to reach through their vocal genius. I am always drawn to a song with good lyrics and good music. Even though I have fascination for rock music, I try to listen every genre as long as it satisfies the two criteria- some good poetic, musical, rhythmic words and the awesome enchanting music - which means I feel the joy. If I think with which I have spent most of my young and adult life- during my time of joy and sorrow, it will definitely be some form of music. Some music just refresh me when I wake up, some just push me to work a little bit harder when I almost give up, some are inevitable in my tired evenings and some just can soothe me and put me to sleep. When I was at my late teen years, when I started exploring the world, when I left my country and started my traveller life, it was the music which accompanied me on my way, it was those headphones that I used to wear everywhere and shake my head in a crowdy train platform surprising everyone. I was always a boy who loves to express where ever he feels to. I felt like a hippy so many times, I discovered the bohemian in me through the music, I realized my spiritual connection with nature through music. Some music are imprinted in my brain so deeply, I can just close my eyes and I can time travel from one corner of the world to other corner, I can fully explore my imaginary world, music works for me as an emotional vehicle, gives me wings to fly, fly higher. I am lucky to have learnt several languages like Bengali, English, Japanese, Hindi- and all these four cultures admire music so much. I wish if I could add Spanish to this, that would be perfect. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoy the similarities and the differences of these different music of different culture. Bengali, being my mother tongue, touches me and caresses me. Most of my crucial teen years, when I was dashing, Japanese music gave me the strength, gave me the power to think broadly, inspired me to explore. And what can I talk about English music - they are just my life in one sentence. From classic rock to alternative rock to pop rock to country, everywhere I swing depending on my mood. And my young life back in Bangladesh was mostly surrounded with Hindi music. No wonder why my romantic me has so many different moods, lol.. I feel like a Bengal tiger, then a Japanese samurai, then an English traveller. I am going to share some music which are very integral to me, has always been with me for some very real reasons, remind of specific time and I will continue listening to them till my last breath. 1.

It's 5:36 am. Still awake. Feeling to smoke. But I have no cigarette with me right now. I just cried for long time. I also cried early in the morning. I don't control what will make me cry. Sometimes random memories come and flush me off. But, after every time I cry, I feel strong. But the crying moments are not pleasant. It takes away all the energy, it makes me bend in the shower. I am pretty sure I would feel ashamed if somebody would see me crying like that. Anyway, I have an exam tomorrow. I think I am going to do very bad. I tried but I know I could have prepared better. Now I need to sleep. I don't know why I am writing now instead of sleeping. I was outside in the balcony with my tears for a while constantly wiping my eyes. I hope I haven't waken up my neighbors. I am sorry. I was looking at the sky, dark sky. And I was just thinking why, why and why. What did I do wrong to feel like this? I know I am not thinking right. I was reading her emails, emails for past several years. I am not supposed to open that folder. I shouldn't have. I don't know why I opened. Again tears are coming to my eyes. But, things went wrong. Things will never get right. Things will never get right. Things will never get right. I used to be happy. I know I need some good things to happen in my life. May be there's a chance to be happy again. But I don't know. Things mean differently now to me. I need to sleep. Hope, there will be some day when it will be easier to push my memories aside. I said to a friend that day I am at peace. May be I am. May be all these were necessary. I came  alone, I will leave alone. May be I will leave sooner. I know I can't make others happy unless I am happy. I am trying. May be I should try harder. Okay, sleeping angels.. please come and take me away for few hours from all the anxieties. I wish I could go back to home across the sea and hug my brother and sister.

In my bed. Got birthday wishes from friends. They were all really nice. I was sleep deprived. Didn't think that I will stay awake till so late. Had fun hanging out in the bars. It wasn't that crowded tonight and it's always good going out with friends who care. Have classes tomorrow morning. Don't know whether I can catch them. But I am feeling happy now. The whole day didn't go very well. I had this weird head ache. But I pushed myself, continued studying and submitted my homeworks. That made me feel good. Have exams. So need to prepare. It would be nice if I could throw a small party at my place tomorrow. May be I can cook some pasta and couscous for everyone. Don't know how many will show up if I arrange a random party. After all it's my birthday. Hope this year will be happier. I just want to live without scars. I just want to smile this year. I just want to see and experience. Love you all.

It's 12:35 am. Just reached home. Not so happy with how the whole day went. Wasn't that bad. But it could have been more productive. Woke up really early. Had to drive a friend to the university health center. Enjoyed the classes. But I think I got some attention deficit disorder now. Can't focus on one thing for long time. Mind just wonders, just wants to escape from any mental struggle. May be it's just laziness. Cooking now. Cooking noodles. Didn't really eat any solid food the whole day. Was drinking my soylent drinks. Now craving for some spicy noddles. It's in the boiling water. Two pots. Veggie and egg in one and the noodles getting boiled in the other. Same routine. I get bored very easily. Oh.. I went to Turkey run this weekend. It was one of my friend's idea. I loved hiking there. Forest, mini rocks, mountains, chirping. Felt awesome being close to nature for few hours. And did some awesome photography. Thanks to Meredith. I can be quite artistic when I take photographs. I am really happy with some of the pictures I have taken. I need to collect them from her. Then we went to Indie- Indianapolis. It was a great time hanging out, walking and talking with Connor. I never walked the Indie downtown that much before. There are some interesting places there to check out. May be I should go there again. Then we went to Steak n Shake later on. The shakes there are really good. And we talked about life, relationship a lot. I always enjoy hanging out with Meredith. She is young, but she is deep. Conner is same too. Anyway, was at Vienna the whole evening doing cheap stuff. Don't know what happened to me. I had full energy and was feeling to talk with literally everyone. Different me. But now I am feeling lonely. The moment I left my car and started walking back to the apartment, the loneliness just engraved me. Glad I got some new music from Aaron at Vienna. Not bad his roommate's music list. Well, my noodles are done now! This is life and let''s enjoy noodles.

Title: Rainbow of illusion
Published Date: Sun, 30 Oct 2016 20:07:49 +0000
Categories & Tags: philosophy
Content:
Feel the emotional shifts. It starts from high above, then it spirals, then it loses down beneath. The sky out there where it wants to mege, the clouds out there with which it wants to mingle , but it fails. But then there's only meaningless gazing. The observant mind is really hard to tackle with. It just doesn't want to stop wandering, all the scattered words just fly through the rainbow of illusion. It loves to remain deluded, but it also doesn't want to stop. But being deluded, there's always a reach, always an end. So it will eventually stop. Then the paths no longer matter, just pushing towards the edge is the constant effort it is trying to make. I wish it could jump on one of the sun rays and travel light years and lose. I wish it could be the gentle breeze which brings smiles but my mind just becomes a cyclone, sometimes a tornado. But it's beautiful, it's charming if violence can be perceived to be charming, it's lively. So, walking by the footpath is not a bad idea as long as you can see the wonderful faces, the masks and the costumes. If it's the game of mind, everybody is playing. May be there's no win or lose, or is there any? But the game itself is fun by its own right. So, there shouldn't be any justification, we should not talk about any verification, any violation, any rules to restrain. Just ruminate and desire. It's all about our emotion that we need to understand and deeply realize. There's no robot among us, only the robotic selves that we construct within us. But it's also okay not to move sometime. But it's not okay to think you somehow can control all your emotions. But you can delude yourself to think so but I don't find it helpful at all. If we create the world, why do we make it unpleasant? May be because you find pleasure to keep it unpleasant. Is that sickness? I won't define it that way though. I'll be very reluctant to do so. Then I need not stop being expressive, I should not refrain myself from being adequately audacious, because that's how I may reach some point that I dream to be in. All the music in my brain is real, then why not making all dance? And I know that they all want to dance. Then why are they scared? Because you get frightened by unknown. So silly, isn't it? Now I can see that you are falling apart, but deep down inside me there's so much fire. So, I live.

What is it that people revolve around? Is it the desires in them that drive them wherever they go or whatever they do? It's hard to tell. I am certain about one thing is that everybody is puzzled. And they are not content or happy with what they already have. Why is that? Why is it so difficult to appreciate things we already own but not focus on the things that is distant? Is it the curious mind which always pushes? Is it just that they are greedy? Or are they envious? If they are envious, that seems to be good, but if they are greedy, then it always leads to unhappiness. It's so evident that you can see others having things that you can't have. So your associative mind is going to compare and sadly it depresses. Why should you be remorseful for things you can not own? Is it too hard to realize your barriers? If you look at life, most of us have the same measure of success. May be that's the problem. If you don't understand what is it that makes you complete, you will always feel incomplete. You want these, that to feel accomplished. But all those needs how many times you scrutinize them? When you fail to achieve things that you badly want, you start feeling bad. I find envy as a positive force, but greed as very negative. And I think people are confused about the subtlety here. We definitely need different measures of success. Things that make him or her happy are not going to make you happy. So chasing for the same thing is just dragging you to the land of nowhere. It's okay to push yourself, but is it okay to drag yourself? But people constantly do. Uncertainty is really mind boggling. We are uncertain about our limitations. It's okay to be uncertain but for how long? Because ultimately you need to be active, right? Now if we think there's a boundary we can't cross, is it positive? On the contrary, thinking about limitations- is it a wise thing? Does that give you any confidence? So there's no doubt that to excel you need to be confident. But are most confidence fake confidence? So how do you distinguish? Anyway, I am full of incoherent questions now.

(scene: Student standing at the front of Professor's office. Thinking about knocking.) (knock knock) Professor: Come in. Take a seat. Student: Thank you. How are you Professor? Professor: I'm doing well. How are you? You seem a little bit disturbed. How may I help you? Student (bit nervous) : Yeah! You are right. I am. It's the end of the semester and also the course.  I really want to thank you for doing a great job in teaching some really difficult concepts. But... But. I came here to talk something that I am really unhappy about, somewhat different if you are interested. I respect your time. Professor (With smile in his face, stood up, moved the curtain to allow more light through the window into the nicely arranged well-scented room full of books in the shelves and some green plants in the corner, came back, took a seat in a more relaxed mood and smiled) : Yes. What is it? Student (now bit confident) : Though I am a big fan of your teaching style in class, I am quite disappointed with the evaluation process. Actually.. I am upset with not only how you evaluate students, but actually how we are evaluated in schools in general. I am quite upset about it. I was thinking a lot, and I felt like to have some perspective from someone who is executing these process. Is it okay if I ask you some questions? Professor: Ok. Student (He opened his bag, brought out his exam paper which have been already scored): As you can see I scored very low. But I didn't come here to talk about my scores. I definitely did very bad in the exam. But do you think I don't understand the topics? Professor: That's hard to tell. Given that you are way below the average, as you can see there are more than half of the students  who performed better than you in the exam. Student: Yes. Exactly. So, an exam is about performance then. Performing on this specific questions that you have put during a fixed time, right? Professor: Yes. Definitely. But because it touches different topics that I taught in the class and you did in the assignments, if you can answer them correctly,  that means you have command over those topics. Student: Ideally yes. I agree. But I think you know that you also have some patterns in putting same questions in the exam. One of the questions are just a little bit of modification of last year exams. And students who solved those questions, I know, are the students who are the high scorers. So, before exams, preparing for the exam is necessary which, for most of the students, mean to solve past year questions. But even, that is not what I came to talk about. Now that we all have scores, half of them are below average and half are above. What is it measuring actually? Does it not just tell that the students with high scores practiced more than the others? Does it really reflect how much we have learnt from your teaching? Professor: Yes. But practice is also very important. If you don't practice, you forget what you have learnt. Student: So, when we get a bad score, what exactly we should feel? I am confused about it. I think I can regret about not practicing more. But I think I started also doubting about my knowledge itself. And I think you also doubt that I haven't learnt much given this score only. And I think that is not true. I reviewed the topics and I think I understand them very well. It's just that I didn't prepare myself for performing good in the exam. Exams just don't drive me. I hate going in one hour exam rooms. I freak out. It's like sports, football or baseball or soccer. All players in both teams know how to score a goal in a soccer game, but one team eventually wins based on their performance. But you need to have two teams in the first place for one team to lose for sure, if not draw. Yeah, not that always the same team is gonna win. And if the loser team gives a good fight, people will also appreciate. But I think we all know a win is a win, a loss is a loss. After even the hardest fight, the loser feels emotionally devastated. That loss might make him work even harder to not do the same mistake and win eventually in future in one hand, or completely destroy his confidence. And these two scenario vary a lot based on individuals. But I am not talking about the game itself. Each game is set up in a way to determine the winner and cheer for them and make the loser sob and weep. Isn't it? So then is education in schools are also like games. Finding and sorting out winners? Making a good resume? Showing how much you have performed? Being a winner in life? Then if that is the case, you need a looser on the other hand. Someone needs to be defeated, someone needs to lose to have the perception of winning for the winner and others. Is it not then set up for some to lose? Professor(now raised his eyebrow, thinking.., taking his time): Hmm. Then how else you propose to evaluate? Student: I don't know. I just can see something is wrong here. Is everybody incapable of seeing it? Or, are they just happy with what it is? And I even didn't bring out so many personal, emotional reality a person might have been going through during the time of his performance. Professor: That is why we sometimes do open book exams or take home exams. The whole point is to make you, students, work hard to learn more. If you didn't have an exam, you wouldn't work hard, right? Student: But you are missing my point. If the ultimate goal is to learn, we are all learning. Some who have interest for some specific material or some who just want to perform really well or some who want to win, is going to perform better. But the evaluation tag that you put on everyone, that tells very less and very void of what the ultimate purpose it should be. Sometimes I feel like may be you all are too lazy to change things for us. Or may be just want us to go through the same grinder you have gone through. But you don't realize the world outside is so different than the world you have experienced in your age. May be you just want the same world. Professor: Hmm. I can't say you are not right. Student: You are driving us for what professor? You want me to solve the differential equations, the other professor wants me to draw a large heart of an amphibia, the other one wants me to measure the percentage of water in the rock, you criticize us when we are not accurate, when we make mistake. It seems like you all know everything, want us to know more, and don't want to do mistake. But then we just feel like being dragged, pressured. My friend is leaving school, don't know what he wants to do. My other friend had her parents divorced on the day of final exam. If you open the google news today, the absolute buffoon Donald J Trump wins the election. What is going on? Why does everything seem so wrong, if we or you know everything for so sure. Professor: Don't you think you are thinking too much? Student: Yes, I am Professor. Yes I am. Thanks for listening. (Student leaves and the Professor starts thinking..)

So.. it was a random trip. I just started driving. Just to breathe some fresh air. And I reached the tippeacanoe battleground. Discovered that there's a museum. Entered and saw a lot of historical stuff. Sharing some of the pictures. There were a lot of different guns used during the battles. Some were locally made. They showcased in chronological orders. There were also some paintings of that time.

Feeling very disconnected. Don't know for exactly why. Actually I perhaps know what may be the case. That's why I am writing. I don't know what I will call my current state. Is it boredom? Is it laziness? None of them seem to be right. Am I feeling impulsive? Am I seeking to get high? Impulsed? Who knows? This is a weird state. Is it withdrawal? May be. I am trying to leave some bad habits. I know how this works? I am feeling restless. That's normal. Or is it? Feeling calm is hard. But I want to be energized, funny, happy. May be these desires are the problem? Don't know. Will it make me happy to get drunk? I know for sure I don't want to be in the crowd of known people. I want to get lost. I want to be missing. Do I have something to hide? May be. That's the problem of putting yourself too much out there. Eventually, in my case, I want to hide. Do I need touch from a woman? Am I lacking love? Surely I do. Why am I so needy? May be. I wish I could be desireless sometimes. But again without desire, you can't really feel. Or can you? I had a great conversation during the noon with one of my friends. We were talking about subjectivity and objectivity. We were talking about how may be over time people are learning to view things more objectively than judging everything subjectively. I don't quite agree with him. But it was nice talking. I was trying to say that everything is subjective. But may be I was wrong. May be I didn't understand him properly. My point was if everything we are sensing, experiencing and judging, then all our perceptions are subjective. But then our perceptions are very non-static and we can not really generalize. But why do we need to even generalize? I just searched about subjective and objective reality. This is what I found in a thread about objectivity: Objectivity: Observational state of mind without emotional attachment.  One is focusing upon objects or experience with  little sense of self in relation to what is being experienced, and the experience is not creating an active emotional response from that person, which if often preferable when discernment is required. Subjectivity: One derives information via referencing themselves and how they are being effected by the world.  The experience contains the information of our own thoughts and feelings to identify with the experience. But then this is what I found. And this is what I was trying to say to my friend: All states of consciousness are mind.  Everything is mind.   Even the material world is mind frequency slowed down to a third dimensional frequency, which gives the illusion of 'solid matter'.  Yet, all objects were first thoughts.  All experiences were first thoughts.  The material world is just the result of previous thinking. Therefore, all reality is SUBJECTIVE. Even objectivity is a subjective experience as we must interpret that which we observe in order to respond to it. I think I can not say better. Feeling slightly better now. :)

There you go again, again the quest for searching places you can merge. You can't stop climbing the walls because you want to see the other side All the dreams you are unsure of and all the reflections you want to absorb. No wander why you can't avoid the surge of your desires. Not that all you can understand in this short span of life, But don't quit trying to make sense of everything that interests you. When the rainbow and it's color are all over in that cloudy sky, You want to walk, you want to walk endlessly, incessantly.

Title: Geneaology of morals

I was reading "On the Genealogy of morals" by Friedrich Nietzsche. It is a very dense book to absorb and I felt like I need to read it again and again and also read some explanations by others. I found a good review on goodreads that I am feeling to post here just to keep track. Thanks to Rowland Bismark's Reviews. On The Genealogy of Morals is made up of three essays, all of which question and critique the value of our moral judgments based on a genealogical method whereby Nietzsche examines the origins and meanings of our different moral concepts. The first essay, "'Good and Evil,' 'Good and Bad'" contrasts what Nietzsche calls "master morality" and "slave morality." Master morality was developed by the strong, healthy, and free, who saw their own happiness as good and named it thus. By contrast, they saw those who were weak, unhealthy, and enslaved as "bad," since their weakness was undesirable. By contrast, the slaves, feeling oppressed by these wealthy and happy masters, called the masters "evil," and called themselves "good" by contrast. The second essay, "'Guilt,' 'Bad Conscience,' and the like" deals with (surprise, surprise) guilt, bad conscience, and the like. Nietzsche traces the origins of concepts such as guilt and punishment, showing that originally they were not based on any sense of moral transgression. Rather, guilt simply meant that a debt was owed and punishment was simply a form of securing repayment. Only with the rise of slave morality did these moral concepts gain their present meanings. Nietzsche identifies bad conscience as our tendency to see ourselves as sinners and locates its origins in the need that came with the development of society to inhibit our animal instincts for aggression and cruelty and to turn them inward upon ourselves. The third essay, "What is the meaning of ascetic ideals?" confronts asceticism, the powerful and paradoxical force that dominates contemporary life. Nietzsche sees it as the expression of a weak, sick will. Unable to cope with its struggle against itself, the sick will sees its animal instincts, its earthly nature, as vile, sinful, and horrible. Unable to free itself from these instincts, it attempts to subdue and tame itself as much as possible. Nietzsche concludes that "man would rather will nothingness than not will." Nietzsche is difficult to read because he demands that we overturn or suspend many of the assumptions that our very reasoning relies upon. He is one of the Western tradition's deepest thinkers precisely because he calls so much into question. If we can come to understand Nietzsche's genealogical method, his doctrine of the will to power, and his perspectivism as all linked, his arguments will become much easier to follow. In Nietzsche's distinction between a thing and its meaning, we find the initial doubt with which Nietzsche unravels so many of our assumptions. We are generally tempted to see things as having inherent meanings. For instance, punishment is at once the act of punishing and the reason behind the punishment. However, Nietzsche argues, these things have had different meanings at different times. For instance, the act of punishment has been at times a celebration of one's power, at times an act of cruelty, at times a simple tit-for-tat. We cannot understand a thing, and we certainly cannot understand its origin, if we assume that it has always held the same meaning. Central to Nietzsche's critique, then, is an attempt at genealogy that will show the winding and undirected route our different moral concepts have taken to arrive in their present shape. Morality is generally treated as sacred because we assume that there is some transcendental ground for our morals, be it God, reason, tradition, or something else. Yet contrary to our assumption that "good," "bad," or "evil" have always had the same meanings, Nietzsche's genealogical method shows how these terms have evolved, shattering any illusion as to the continuity or absolute truth of our present moral concepts. Because they can have different, even contradictory, meanings over the course of their long life spans, Nietzsche does not believe that concepts or things are the fundamental stuff that makes up reality. Instead, he looks beneath these things to see what drives the different meanings that they adopt over time. Hiding beneath he finds force and will. All of existence, Nietzsche asserts, is a struggle between different wills for the feeling of power. This "will to power" is most evident on a human level, where we see people constantly competing with one another, often for no other purpose than to feel superior to those that they overcome. That a thing has a meaning at all means that there is some will dominating it, bending it toward a certain interpretation. That a thing may have different meanings over time suggests that different wills have come to dominate it. For instance, the concept of "good" was once dominated by the will of healthy, strong barbarians, and had the opposite meaning that it does now that it is dominated by the will of weak, "sick" ascetics. According to Nietzsche, then, a belief in an absolute truth or an absolute anything is to give in to one particular meaning, one particular interpretation of a thing. It is essentially to allow oneself to be dominated by a particular will. A will that wishes to remain free will shun absolutes of all kinds and try to look at a matter from as many different perspectives as possible in order to gain its own. This doctrine that has deeply influenced postmodern thought is called "perspectivism." Nietzsche's inquiries are thus conducted in a very irreverent spirit. Nothing is sacred, nothing is absolute, nothing, we might even say, is true. Our morality is not a set of duties passed down from God but an arbitrary code that has evolved as randomly as the human species itself. The only constant is that we, and everything else, are constantly striving for more power, and the only constant virtue is a will that is powerful, and free from bad conscience, hatred, and ressentiment. Nietzsche's main project in the Genealogy is to question the value of our morality. Ultimately, he argues that our present morality is born out of a resentment and hatred that was felt toward anything that was powerful, strong, or healthy. As such, he sees our present morality as harmful to the future health and prosperity of our species. While the "blonde beasts" and barbarians of primitive master morality are animalistic brutes, at least they are strong and healthy. On the other hand, our present ascetic morality has "deepened" us by turning our aggressive instincts inward and seeing ourselves as a new wilderness to struggle against. Nietzsche's ideal is to maintain this depth and yet not be ashamed of our animal instincts or of the life that glows within us.

I think everyone at some point in life wishes that there's some meaning or purpose of the life they are living. And I think most people have some sort of sense of purpose that help them move to their next moment. Some derive the purpose from their religion, some find it in pursuing happiness, some find it in their job. Billions of people are around me and almost everyone is living a slightly different life than mine. Sure, there are similarities. But what I mean is that everyone has their own individual world, own purpose of why they are doing what they are doing. I was watching the TV show Vikings and it struck me in so many ways. The morals that we have were way different back then. What is good for society, what is right versus what is wrong was quite drastically different in ancient times. The conflicts between in group and out group are still prevalent. Do you kill your husband or wife because of adultery?  Can you love someone but be wife or husband of someone else? Can you raise someone else's  baby in your wife's womb? How you act when all your efforts come down to failures. What makes you famous, what makes you remarkable? How we have changed into a society where we feel the necessity of knowledge? There's so much that was different. So, are we better? May be we don't even need to look at ancient times. In our modern life, culturally a part of middle east is so different than this small city of Midwest US. We can all say that everywhere in the world there are some changes compared to the past. But still the norms, structures, activities are quite significantly different. Now, at an individual level, at any certain moment, you are living somewhere. You can not live in two places at the same time in your physical world. But you, having an experience of difference, can create multitude of virtual world inside you, you can compare, you can judge and you may act upon your thoughts, your beliefs. A woman who is wearing hijab, a man who is following some Hindu ritual, a priest who is being ascetic in a city like Paris or like Chicago where most are drinking, singing, dancing and consuming everything the capitalistic culture provides, is definitely living in a different world within their surrounding physical world. It's astonishing how our thoughts, beliefs can take over our reality, or shape our reality. How same things mean so differently to different persons? Anyway, sometimes it's hard for me to fathom all these. What do most people do? I think thinking about all these are pretty exhausting for most. That's why people stop thinking, stop worrying. Yeah, by thinking, by worrying too much, what can you change really except stressing yourself? But then we can argue that if you can not critically think, you will miss a lot of things. I am drinking in a bar in this Saturday evening, waiting for some friends and writing everything that's passing through my head. What I feel like, everything I or and my body does is just to pass this moment. Sometimes I'm enjoying the moment and sometimes I'm not.

Title: Why I feel what I feel?

22nd January, 2017. I'm here on a sunday just sitting on my couch thinking incessantly. It's calm and quiet outside in this cold cloudy winter morning but I wish it was calmer and quieter inside me. I was thinking about how we feel. When I woke up day before yesterday, I felt resentful, hostile; yesterday when I woke up, I felt somewhat afraid, somewhat neutral and today now that I am awake, I am feeling analytical, bit hopeful. I can dig deeper and always using causality relationship, can approximately analyze what happened the last night or last day and bring a reason for my feeling such and such. On a certain moment, there's various feelings I can feel. I can feel differently for a same incident which means that I can not give a definitive answer for why I feel what I feel. But there's definitely two big sets of good and bad feelings. I may be able to categorize my feelings as good feelings versus bad. As our emotional, psychic or spiritual interests go, we tend to crave for good feelings but who will disagree that most of the time you are just craving for it and what you really have are complications inside you. But whenever I feel now a days that cravings, I banish myself asking - who told me that I need to feel good, weren't my bad days were the days that pushed me to change myself. But is it the hope then for a good day that pushes you through your bad day? And when good day comes, you try to celebrate and you get the justification for all your struggle. But are all lucky that way? What if your struggle never stops and you never succeed. So, is there any alternative to this hope based model for living? I certainly based my life on my hopes and dreams. And I can tell you when your hopes and dreams are destroyed, you will feel to cease yourself. This model constantly requires you to be resilient, requires you to create new hope and new dreams when all your old hopes and old dreams are gone. But the problem is you may sometimes have deep attachment with some of these which may be very crucial for your existence. Life is cruel, life is full of struggle, so I don't think any static model can give answers to all problems in every kind of circumstance perpetually. The complexity of life requires constant awareness and inspection and the ability to change.  What is that brought dissatisfaction to life? Oops, that's such a big question, right? Isn't it that you want something and you fail to achieve it is what that causes all discomfort? So, your desire is the cause of your sufferings then? That's why people go to solitary places, monks confine themselves in caves, an urban monk detaches himself from everything surrounding him- at least tries to, so all are to try to not desire or at least not to desire for some time being? Because our knowledge of our psychology shows that you can not use your logic against strong deceptions, illusions. I have watched several TED videos now on predictable irrationality, cognitive influence and it's well-known, you just can't avoid being deluded, influenced. So, what you subject yourself to will influence you and will lead you. Now, when you ride a horse, in every turn you pull so that your horse can choose the right direction, but when there are no turns sometimes you just let your horse ride by its own. Do you really always want to control your emotion? You don't. Because then you will miss a lot but also you don't want to get lost either, you don't want to feel deceived either. So, you have to watch your steps sometimes. I was feeling to sum up a lot of other thoughts but I will keep it short today as I will have to go. There's always something else that tide me over.

I am seriously thinking about starting meditation again. The peace of mind is quite rare to obtain these days. I find myself very easily distracted, find it really hard to concentrate, find it hard to remember, find it hard to forget. I was reading about meditation and it's different form. I loved some of Sam Harris's quote (original post) and am reposting. I will elaborate the part that intrigued me when I have some time later on. Although the insights we can have in meditation tell us nothing about the origins of the universe, they do confirm some well-established truths about the human mind: Our conventional sense of self is an illusion; positive emotions, such as compassion and patience, are teachable skills; and the way we think directly influences our experience of the world. The conventional sense of self is an illusion [and] spirituality largely consists in realizing this, moment to moment. There are logical and scientific reasons to accept this claim, but recognizing it to be true is not a matter of understanding these reasons. Like many illusions, the sense of self disappears when closely examined, and this is done through the practice of meditation. […] The feeling that we call “I” seems to define our point of view in every moment, and it also provides an anchor for popular beliefs about souls and freedom of will. And yet this feeling, however imperturbable it may appear at present, can be altered, interrupted, or entirely abolished. The self that does not survive scrutiny is the subject of experience in each present moment — the feeling of being a thinker of thoughts inside one’s head, the sense of being an owner or inhabitant of a physical body, which this false self seems to appropriate as a kind of vehicle. Even if you don’t believe such a homunculus exists — perhaps because you believe, on the basis of science, that you are identical to your body and brain rather than a ghostly resident therein — you almost certainly feel like an internal self in almost every waking moment. And yet, however one looks for it, this self is nowhere to be found. It cannot be seen amid the particulars of experience, and it cannot be seen when experience itself is viewed as a totality. However, its absence can be found — and when it is, the feeling of being a self disappears. We wouldn’t attempt to meditate, or engage in any other contemplative practice, if we didn’t feel that something about our experience needed to be improved. But here lies one of the central paradoxes of spiritual life, because this very feeling of dissatisfaction causes us to overlook the intrinsic freedom of consciousness in the present. As we have seen, there are good reasons to believe that adopting a practice like meditation can lead to positive changes in one’s life. But the deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self — and to seek such freedom, as though it were a future state to be attained through effort, is to reinforce the chains of one’s apparent bondage in each moment. The ultimate wisdom of enlightenment, whatever it is, cannot be a matter of having fleeting experiences. The goal of meditation is to uncover a form of well-being that is inherent to the nature of our minds. It must, therefore, be available in the context of ordinary sights, sounds, sensations, and even thoughts. Peak experiences are fine, but real freedom must be coincident with normal waking life. Those who begin to practice in the spirit of gradualism often assume that the goal of self-transcendence is far away, and they may spend years overlooking the very freedom that they yearn to realize. [This approach] encourages confusion at the outset regarding the nature of the problem one is trying to solve. It is true, however, that striving toward the distant goal of enlightenment (as well as the nearer goal of cessation) can lead one to practice with an intensity that might otherwise be difficult to achieve. I never made more effort than I did when practicing under U Pandita. But most of this effort arose from the very illusion of bondage to the self that I was seeking to overcome. The model of this practice is that one must climb the mountain so that freedom can be found at the top. But the self is already an illusion, and that truth can be glimpsed directly, at the mountain’s base or anywhere else along the path. One can then return to this insight, again and again, as one’s sole method of meditation — thereby arriving at the goal in each moment of actual practice. It is very difficult to imagine someone’s not being able to see her reflection in a window even after years of looking — but that is what happens when a person begins most forms of spiritual practice. Most techniques of meditation are, in essence, elaborate ways for looking through the window in the hope that if one only sees the world in greater detail, an image of one’s true face will eventually appear. Imagine a teaching like this: If you just focus on the trees swaying outside the window without distraction, you will see your true face. Undoubtedly, such an instruction would be an obstacle to seeing what could otherwise be seen directly. Almost everything that has been said or written about spiritual practice, even most of the teachings one finds in Buddhism, directs a person’s gaze to the world beyond the glass, thereby confusing matters from the very beginning. But one must start somewhere. And the truth is that most people are simply too distracted by their thoughts to have the selflessness of consciousness pointed out directly. And even if they are ready to glimpse it, they are unlikely to understand its significance. Embracing the contents of consciousness in any moment is a very powerful way of training yourself to respond differently to adversity. However, it is important to distinguish between accepting unpleasant sensations and emotions as a strategy — while covertly hoping that they will go away — and truly accepting them as transitory appearances in consciousness. Only the latter gesture opens the door to wisdom and lasting change. The paradox is that we can become wiser and more compassionate and live more fulfilling lives by refusing to be who we have tended to be in the past. But we must also relax, accepting things as they are in the present, as we strive to change ourselves. […] Happiness and suffering, however extreme, are mental events. The mind depends upon the body, and the body upon the world, but everything good or bad that happens in your life must appear in consciousness to matter. This fact offers ample opportunity to make the best of bad situations — changing your perception of the world is often as good as changing the world — but it also allows a person to be miserable even when all the material and social conditions for happiness have been met. During the normal course of events, your mind will determine the quality of your life. The human nervous system is plastic in a very important way — which means your experience of the world can be radically transformed. You are tending who you were yesterday by virtue of various habit patterns and physiological homeostasis and other things that are keeping you very recognizable to yourself, but it’s possible to have a very different experience… It’s possible to do it through a deliberate form of training, like meditation, and I think it’s crucial to do — because we all want to be as happy and as fulfilled and as free of pointless suffering as can possibly be. And all of our suffering, and all of our unhappiness, is a product of how our minds are in every moment. So if there’s a way to use the mind itself to improve one’s capacity for moment-to-moment wellbeing — which I’m convinced there is — then this should be potentially of interest to everybody.

We are human being. We are gullible, we are breakable. I was feeling afraid.  I woke up early today, started the day confidently , with determination and will of getting things done. But then after an hour, I got distracted. I remembered a very old memory which made me sad. But then I felt okay. Every time a past memory blows me, now I tell that I need to make a good present memory to fight against. May be that's the only optimistic way to deal with and be productive in life. But sometimes it's tremendously hard to accept the loss, to deny the desire of getting something back that was so dear to yourself. But then impossible is a word that should be, arguably !!,  found in the dictionary of the fools, right?  The sudden emergence or intervention of some thoughts is something that I am very fearful about. There are certain experiences that I never want to have again. There are pains that I never want to experience again. That means there is weakness in me, there are holes in my mind where if I fall, I tend to feel unable to get out of. Now can knowing your own weakness be your strength? I think it should be the case. Because as I said, we are all vulnerable, we all have weaknesses. I was thinking about a lot of things. I can see around how people manipulate other people, I can read stories of selfishness and selflessness, it hurts to see how some take advantage of others. We are all linked, aren't we? If no students would go to the university, what would all the professors, staff do? If no one would want to drink, with whom would all the bars and clubs be filled with? If everyone would like to cook, then how would all these restaurants run themselves? If all would like to walk or bike, would somebody get killed in fatal road accident? If everyone was not interested to see televisions, movies, then who would be the consumer of all those entertainments and advertisements.  If everyone would only focus on his own life, who would worship the celebrities?  There's so many ifs- I am probably asking questions like a baby who is trying to understand why are all these happening around us. It seems this whole society and all societal acts are based on a service based system. Someone needs something, so someone else needs to help them out. Someone has knowledge about something, that other can use. We are all depending on each other in some way or another. It doesn't matter whether you talk with anyone or not, you need to eat, you need to work, so you need someone for something implicitly or explicitly. I was thinking about mistakes. Now, it's easy to see that all these dependencies can not always go without errors. We are all error prone. We will make mistake, then we will hurt other people. So, disaster is inevitable. So, failure is also inevitable. Being cautious is necessary. You just should never stop.

I love this poem by Edgar Allan Poe. It touches so much with my inner feelings that I feel exalted. The poem with its words captures so nicely the dream and the flow of reality that this body and mind experiences. But yet it expresses desire, desire to hold, desire to grasp, then it still remains suspicious. A Dream Within A Dream - Edgar Allan Poe Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow — You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream. I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand — How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep — while I weep! O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?

There's only one sun and only one visible moon. And there's only one heart beeping inside, always embezzled by events and all the hereabouts. You wish that you can keep a permanent relaxed state but life without tension is a rare catch. So, the mornings are awkwardly different, the noons are assumingly hectic, the afternoons are eccentric, the evenings are about experiencing the switch between light and darkness, the nights are simultaneously welcoming and unwelcoming but what is it that can fill you up is yet to be unknown or unrevealed; just let it be. The joys and delights- they are better perceived, experienced when they are unpredictably available. There's no escape from monotony but isn't boredom a preconceived notion to you? You can deal with uncertainties, you sure can. Even if all your efforts for making things certain in your hand, in your mind fail, you are still creating something, you are still breathing, walking and dancing. Ultimately, it's all just a bit of your momentary expression born out of your feelings and actions. May be it's easy if you always have something to do tomorrow, something to achieve that can be significant in your timeline, may be you choose to be solitary to be introspective, may be you want to mingle to behave, may be you are closed to entertain yourself, may be you are open to entertain others, but you just do it the way you feel and you try to replicate, not always successfully, but it's good to discover new you within you, so you continue asking questions to search for some of the answers. Newness is charming, old can be boring. But you needed the old to create the new, so be in love with both, make a bridge between the two, they will clash but for good reasons, for the purpose of your new you to be born in the finite stream of countably infinite next moments. It's too short, no point of putting yourself in misery by taking the extraterrestrial vehicles. The fact that you can still dream is magical.

Title: Message Passing using OpenMPI : Production and Consumption via Broker
Published Date: Sat, 01 Apr 2017 18:25:54 +0000
Categories & Tags: Algorithms, CoderMind, algorithm, openmpi, parallel computing, programming
Content:
I am working on several assignments and through the problem solving process, I am learning OpenMPI. OpenMPI is a great library that gives you capability of using multiple CPUs in parallel. Think about you are given 100 random numbers which are not sorted. Normally you would write a sequential program where you will implement a O(nlogn) sorting algorithm like quick sort or merge sort to sort those random numbers in an increasing or decreasing order. But what if you partition the 100 numbers into 10 buckets. And sort each bucket using your sequential sort algorithm parallelly using 10 process. At the end, you need to combine those 10 buckets. This is just an example of how using parallel process, we can speedup. Sometimes certain information needs to be synchronized in all running processes for further computation. Unlike threads, processes don't share shared memory. So, you can not really use a global variable for storing. Moreover, you can never exactly tell which instruction are being executed by  a process at a certain moment. The way processes communicate with each other is through sending and receiving messages. That is why MPI stands for Message Passing Interface. The first problem that I have been working is a problem where a producer produces item and send item to broker, then broker receives the message, saves it in its internal buffer and finally, sends acknowledgement message back to the producer. However, a broker can only insert a newly produced item into the buffer only if the buffer is not full. In case, the buffer is full, the producers will be waiting. Broker also waits for consumer request to consume items. A consumer sends request to broker and if the buffer is not empty, the broker sends an item for consumption to the consumer on receiving a valid request. While handling the consumer request, the broker also releases the waiting producer by inserting the produced items when the buffer becomes free. This whole production, consumption scheme now needs to run for a given amount of time. There are several challenges in implementing this parallel program. Deadlock is a common issue in parallel  programming. It occurs when two or multiple processes race against each other for accessing the same resource. Imagine a professor is discussing with his two students. Let's assume the old professor can only remember one question at a time (his memory is like the communication buffer). The first student asks the professor a question, until the professor answers the question, the second student can not ask any question. Now imagine, if the first student is constantly asking question, the second student may not get chance to ask at all. (....) [code lang=text] // Question 1.

Title: Live Bravely

It takes a while to calm down, to stay relaxed. Waking up worried is just a norm; the moment the eye is open, the rush of the upcoming meeting, the unread twenty-five emails, the missed calls, the replies on facebook which are supposed to be already sent, the worry about the electricity and internet bills, the cold war with your room mate, the unfinished project, the anxiety of failing in the assignment, the silence from her, the noise of the surrounding - all can be overwhelming. The random thoughts will take you here and then there and in the end, you will find yourself out of nowhere, passing several hours. But then you will probably listen Pharrel William's wonderful song "Happy" because happiness is something that's missing, you will feel. And then the joy- out of nothing, random joy and pleasure that you haven't really expected. Suddenly when that beautiful stranger girl will smile at you when you were walking absent minded on the pave way, you will feel the rush of good feelings. When your friend will say that he is missing you, you will feel needed. When you will read some silly jokes on 9Gag, you will start laughing your ass off when everybody's trying to concentrate and then joyfully feel the awkwardness in you. You just want to be relevant - don't you? You just don't love to be ignored. You know that all these are within your psychological reach, but you still can not always trick yourself. Why is so much craving for having been seen? The book "Craving For Ecstasy" that I have been reading is saying- Given that we may voluntarily alter our neurotransmission to achieve a desired feeling, why do only some of us become compulsively involved in this pursuit? After all, most people can have a drink or occasionally rage at the race track without going off the deep end. Most addictionologists - even those who disagree about other matters of causation and treatment - agree that low self-regard is a crucial factor in all forms of addiction. The chronic absence of good feelings about oneself provokes a dependence on mood-changing activity. Manifest or masked, feelings of low self-worth are basic to dysfunctional life-styles. That high self-regard that keeps you motivated is an absolute necessity. That's why you need good news after all the bad news. And for that, you just need to live bravely the next moment.

Title: Thinking about intelligence

So.. we, human are intelligent beings. Life ,in general; here I am talking about all forms of life, not just human beings but all living beings, seems to be a race for acquiring more intelligence to solve the existing problems, improve the way of living and to infer and predict the future using the accumulated intelligence of present and past. Think about a typical day of yours. You wake up, shit, eat, think, plan, work, eat, shit, work, think, plan, play, mate, sleep, wake up... Now every human may have some uniqueness in how they organize or  re-orient these behaviors along with the plethora of common behaviors. And definitely these small changes, re-orientation or orders of behaviors make you different than me, make each one of us, in fact, unique, make a chimpanzee different than you even though chimpanzees share 96% of your DNA. However, I am trying to focus on the general common behaviors here to later mention the importance of intelligence. Think about a day from ancient time, may be just imagine that you were the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten from the 18th dynasty who ruled for 17 years and is especially noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian polytheism. Now you are reborn in this age. Now how different was your regular day then from now? Weren't you going through the same cycle of daily events? And if you carefully look, lots animals also have the same behaviors, in a broad sense, except the important two behaviors - think and plan. So, thinking and planning are the keys. When a child is born in this world, it already has its innate human abilities, but then it needs to learn; it needs to learn to stand up, walk, talk, interact using all the senses. Learning can be challenging. The rate you learn is important, the way you learn is important, the desire to learn is important. What you learn from your surroundings is what defines you ultimately. In a way, it's the matter of experiencing what's happening outside you, acquiring knowledge about how physics, chemistry work, what is dangerous versus what is not, understanding your physical limitations, storing all the knowledge and being able to use them when necessary. Now how efficiently you can use the knowledge you gained gives a good measure of your intelligence. Sometimes just having enough information can give you an edge over others. Like, when you are pursuing a career.. Let's say you are a doctor; that means you have more information about how human body works, how to treat certain abnormalities of human body which are known to be treatable, let's say you are a physicist; you try to gain all the rules of the physical world and try to understand physical events of the universe and challenge yourself to answer some of the unsolved questions like when did time start, let's say you are a farmer; you have the information about when to sow seeds, when to wipe away the weeds, when to water, if you are an agricultural engineer; you have information about how to engineer or breed new crops to produce more food. So, work of some sort in general requires gathering specific information related to that specific work. And as an intelligent being, you try to use your information, increase your knowledge, solve particular problems in your work area. The basic challenge of life is to feed yourself everyday which requires access to food, which requires access to money, which requires certain skills to earn money, which drives you to grow to learn certain things of your interest. A day is like planning different actions, making priorities for solving different problems of your life. So, thinking and planning are the two necessary things which you need to master. The better you can solve your problems of feeding yourself, entertaining yourself, communicating your needs, understanding others, gaining edge over others to prove your uniqueness, the more intelligent you are. I am looking everything from a problem solving perspective. Some may say that you need to learn about how to ask questions, how to approach, how to employ different solutions, how to look from different angles, how to think to identify the patterns, how to plan in an organized way and then how to execute accordingly. Now what will be super intelligence. Is it just the extension from intelligence, just to be able to store more information, compute more approaches so that you stumble upon new ways so that you can give better answers to the questions posed? I was watching Sam Harris asking whether we can build AI without losing control over it. I liked this part where he mentioned how we will just continue forever.. .., given how valuable intelligence and automation are, we will continue to improve our technology if we are at all able to. What could stop us from doing this? A full-scale nuclear war? A global pandemic? An asteroid impact? Justin Bieber becoming president of the United States? .. The second assumption is that we will keep going. We will continue to improve our intelligent machines. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nt3edWLgIg&w=560&h=315] He talks about general intelligence which ,in his words, is an ability to think flexibly across multiple domains. Intelligence is a matter of information processing in physical systems. We have already built narrow intelligence into our machines, and many of these machines perform at a level of superhuman intelligence already. And we know that mere matter can give rise to what is called "general intelligence," an ability to think flexibly across multiple domains, because our brains have managed it. I probably disagree when he said the rate of progress doesn't matter, because any progress is enough to get us into the end zone. But may be he tried to mean somethings else. Then I also watched talking another visionary Ray Kurzweil. He gives a evolutionary history of how we reached where we are now as a mammal by expanding our pre-frontal cortex and then he proposes how we can take us to make another leap towards being more intelligent. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVXQUItNEDQ&w=560&h=315] Anyway, it's all exciting to think about how our futures will shape, how we will even define intelligence and how we will strive to be more intelligent.

Well, he hasn't been here for last two weeks. Did anybody care? Did we really bring him into the conversation? He was invisible, did we feel his necessity? May be some closed ones did, but it wasn't that inconceivable or unthinkable without the presence of him. Was it? And he left this place, a month or two ago, he was here everyday, he was integral to every morning of this wonderful place. Didn't we already stop missing him? We did. And then he died, nobody knew him. He is not being missed either. We just talk about him sometimes and then it fades away. Well, our mind at a time only can hold a little in its tiny working memory, so we need to leave things behind us. We are not really big necessity for anything ultimately, it's just that we try to be relevant up to some point. It's just like a freak show everyday, some noise, some rumbling, then all quiet and calm and it's all gone. Without you, the freak show would still continue, is that realization give any sensation of fear or frustration? It's all inside you. All those chattering, all those blabbering - it's all what you and only you collected from your outside. Not many of them will linger more than few hours. The eternal process of literally losing everything will go on. Isn't she happy now? Does she really care what happened on this day five year, six years ago? All that matter is what's she eating for her lunch now. That's all matter. It's all about you and your desire as long as they don't collide to hurt someone else, you will be treated fine and won't need any medication. Look at him, he is checking her ass like he has never seen such a beautiful thing before. What a spark on his face full of lust, but how long that will last? Well, who said it needs to be lasting? But isn't that what we try with everything? Make it sustain, make it sustain, don't try to forget, remember this, remember that, earn this skill, earn that. Well, it's all in vain. Or may be not. All you need to do is to not care.

Adversity is not always bad. In fact, adversity or lack of something provoke you to come up with some useful solution. If everything you need is right at your reach, it may feel comfortable but I am telling you that it's delusional to think that state as a sustainable one. It's not a stable situation where you don't feel the lag or emptiness. It's probably only an utopian state where you get everything ready, prepared, arranged or organized around you. So, the lack of something, the emptiness may bother us, frustrate us, bring anxiety to our psyche but then those same feelings force us to do something, do something to fill the gap or the void. And sometimes we may turn out to be really creative that can impress our own selves. Innovation at its heart depends on the desire to solve an issue, a problem and being passionate or motivated towards implementing those solutions. And when we have absence of something we truly want; the shortage, the scarcity of the elements, materials or instruments; the unavailability or deficit of the required things turn on our discoverer us to flow, move, interact, look and experiment. It's not always alright to have vertical structure, sometimes we need to inspect horizontally. Going deeper and deeper may sometimes make us at a loss when we need to look widely. One important thing adversity tells us that you can solve anything you want with only the things that you have at hand. Focus on the things that you have and carefully examine, investigate whether there's a possible scenario to create. When you are smart, adversity is blessing in disguise. I realize more now the words of Steve Jobs Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

What is it that defines power? Is it the ability of doing something? Is it the acknowledgement? How does the transformation from the powerlessness to powerfulness occur? Is it that power already lies inside us? Is it that we are always potentially powerful? Only when the event of the demonstration of power happens, we realize it? But people seem to actively seek for power as if it lie's somewhere outside. Is money power? It seems everyone believes having more money will give them more power. Is the purchasing power equivalent to the psychological power? Given that we live in a knowledge, information economy, does the acquisition of more information make us more powerful? What is the main semantic difference between power and energy? I am energetic vs I am powerful- they sound different, why? What gives you energy vs what gives you power? Is energy more like a physical thing, whereas power is more psychological? Do you choose to be powerful? Do you choose to be powerless? Is it a zero sum game?

He is walking on the street. The warm afternoon is somewhat helping him think clearly. The stores around here are quite familiar. The bookstore in the corner still looks the same. There was a shoe store right opposite to the office building near the crossing but it is now replaced by a pizza shop. Now he suddenly becomes sad. He just remembered the day when he bought a converse for her from that store. They both were walking on this street and they stopped right in front of the ice cream stall in front of the building when they could see the store across the street. He can still visualize that afternoon but may be it would have been easier to remember some details if the store was still there. He closes his eyes. She chose red color and it was a nice looking converse. He couldn't remember whether she was already decided to buy red before they came to the store or was it that specific red converse that took all her attention? She probably doesn't have that red converse anymore. He tried to think the last time she wore it. But he couldn't remember. All he can think is her smiley face when she was trying it. She probably also jumped a bit to see how comfortable it would feel while running. The guy in the store was bringing more converse but he might have also been convinced that she would go for the red one from her expression. She asked him how she looked on the red converse. He just smiled and she knew what it meant. She also smiled back. He now turns around because he didn't want to remember more. He walks straight towards the smokeshop. It's been a while he wasn't smoking but now he feels the need for a distraction. Nicotine helps.

Title: Fossil Record as a way to learn earth history

Who studies fossils? A Paleontologist. Why do paleontologists study fossils? Because fossil record brings information, provides clues, ideas about climatic changes of the planet, the evolution of geographical changes occurred on earth. For example, plant fossils and pollen fossils have been used to indicate climatic change of earth. To create geologic timescale, scientists have used fossils. We can see the fossil evolution during Paleogene period (over 66 Million years ago) in the image below. You can see the branches and subbranches in the image. The Subbotina trivialis (genus: Subbotina, species: trivialis) is highlighted in red. [caption id="attachment_2198" align="alignnone" width="1250"] Evolution of Planktonic fossils during Paleogene period. The fossil image of Subbotina Trivialis has been shown in the rectangular yellow window. Subbotina Trivialis has found around 65.5 Million years ago.[/caption] Determining the age of fossil is very important and very challenging. Fossils are very often found in rocks and comparing one rock formation with another (relative dating), it's possible to find a relative age for a fossil. Dating rocks involve calculating the rate of decay of radioactive element such as Carbon-14, Uranium-238, Potassium-40, Aluminium-26, Samarium-147, rubidiam-87, strontium-87. Fossilization is a rare event as there may not be any trace of an organism after its extinction. Therefore the record of an organism as the record of life in a fossil is something very significant to discover. The organism's physical structure and subsequently deduced information such as it's environment, diet, life-cycle can be obtained by studying fossils. Trace fossils, or fossilized marks left as a result of the activities of creatures such as trails, footprints, and burrows are also recorded and used as the source of information. From the fossil records throughout geologic time, scientists understood that the evolution of life is not a linear process. Sometimes the process is slow and sometimes it's exponential. We also discovered that there might be periodicity in mass extinction by studying fossil records. Even the concept of plate tectonics was helped by fossil records. The more I am learning about fossils, the more exciting it's becoming.

Just waiting for my espresso shot at starbucks. I just woke up few minutes earlier and the first thing that I crave for when I wake up is sunlight and fresh air. So, I started biking in the campus; all the familiar roads - narrow and wide - it's a beautiful sunny morning and I'm enjoying the refreshing outside. It's probably soon going to be warm, so I'm happy not to miss this small window of comfort. The summer Purdue campus this year was a mess really, in fact, the whole West Lafayette was a mess with constructions with their screaching metallic sounds everywhere. Just to cross the Chauncey area street you would literally have to walk quarter miles to avoid sands and dirts. The nice bookshop there seems to be going away which is sad. The shop used to have lots of interesting stuff and I had some good memories with friends too. So, I'll miss it. Last night was thirsty Thursday night which means I was hanging out with my friends at Cactus. ;) I didn't get too much wasted but sometimes those Thursday nights are just eventless and feel meaningless. But sometimes some night's are unexpectedly awesome. But anyway, after a day of working in a quiet lab thinking about science and trying to understand the words in journals and papers and trying to understand the crazy scientists, the urge is just too strong to get lost in crowd and noise at night, at least for me. Anyway, coming back to the moment, I'm sitting right now with my espresso shot outside of the Starbucks at the nice flowery corner in front of the Krach Leadership center. I like this spot a lot. From here you can have a nice view of the recreational center and watching sunset from the other side in the evening is charming too. Even though I hate these constructions, but they were progressively making the campus look really newer and nicer. One thing that boggles everyone who is new around here and driving a car is those one way streets and some of them are now turned two way streets. Many many thanks.. There are some new food corners back there where I haven't checked in yet even after three years of roaming around. See, there's always things unnoticed. I'm almost done with my espresso shot now; in between writing my thoughts here, I already checked Facebook several times, already had a small online slack meeting with my student giving him instructions for his task and for sure, listening music. I am listening folk songs today, the whole last week I was listening rock and metals. It's nice being engaged with things, with interactions with people; may be that's one way of not getting bored. But then again you need to be with yourself too and see whether you are not being confused with these infinite stream of events around. It's not nice feeling lonely too. I'll have to admit that I do feel lonely even in the midst of plenty of people, even in the midst of handling so many things. It's kind of interesting and may be it's sort of a bad illusion of my mind that it often longs for the things which are missing but forgets to appreciate the things which are present. Living in the moment is not really easy after all. Mind always drags to the past or the future. And that's why I like writing as it helps me think through.  I'll have to move now, to some other corner of the campus doing something else. I love learning and I'll engage myself to find some new ideas for today.

Title: Feeling Home

It's nice to be home. A place where it feels comfortable, where you feel to come back, where you can relax, where you can leave the worries away and just chill. I just moved to a new apartment, actually quite close to my last one. I hate the arduous process of moving, but I'm happy to move to this new place. I like how the surrounding is calm and quieter, love the greens and the shades from the tree. The small front lawn up to the back door through the living room and the kitchen look like a wide corridor for the wind and light to pass through. I actually was excitingly decorating my living room so that it doesn't look empty and feel bit artsy. I went to the Walmart and bought some cheap table decoration stuff. My favorite one is the hour glass. I was lucky to meet this family in my town who were moving to a new house and they cheaply sold a lot of furniture to me which are mainly occupying my living room now. I have a decent music system in the living room but I wish I had better speakers. I wored several hours on my wall posters, I was originally thinking about buying posters but good posters are so expensive and I couldn't find the kind of posters I like. I wanted to have some inspirational quotes and good expressions and I wanted it to be cheap. So, in the end, I found some large nice google images with the kind of quote, characters, expressions, then I pasted them on excel and printed partial pieces on A4 size papers on which then I had to cut edges for several hours and pasted them on the wall according to the order. Now I have a Robin Williams Poster which says, I say to you, 'Hey, look at me.' Please, don't worry so much, because in the end none of us have very long on this earth - life is fleeting. And if you're ever distressed, cast your eyes to the summer sky when the stars are strung across the velvetly night, and when a shooting star streaks through the blackness turning night into day, make a wish and think of me. Make your life spectacular. I know I did. Then at its left, above my guitar, I have the phenomenal Jimmy Hendrick's poster, When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace. And my most favorite one in the opposite wall is from Einstein, Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love. Anyway, I am happy how it looks and feels now. And I think my friends liked my place too. Yesterday I had my housewarming party. A lot of my friends and their friends came. We howled, drank and had quite a party till late night. And I am at my home now writing.. :)

Title: Looking Inside Eminem's Lyrics - part 1
Published Date: Tue, 08 Aug 2017 23:26:48 +0000

Content:
I started analyzing the lyrics of Eminem. My initial interest is that what are the most common words Eminem has been using in his lyrics. I collected the name of all his 287 songs from this link. Then I collected the lyrics using python sontext library which collects lyrics from lyricwiki.org. I have become successful in gathering lyrics for 223 songs of Eminem out of those 287 song names using my python code. After gathering the lyrics, I had to process the text in the lyrics. Normally in language processing tasks, we do chunking, lemmatization, stemming, spelling error check. I have used NLTK library for all these. Actually I had to avoid doing lemmatization as it was chopping off lots of interesting words in its existing form. And also I created a banned words list as Eminem has used a lot of 'na', 'wa', 'oh' kind of words which semantically doesn't have much meaning.  Then I used NLTK word frequency method to find out the frequency of words. The top 20 words used were [(u'like', 1375), (u'get', 1049), (u'got', 907), (u'shit', 740), (u"'cause", 729), (u'know', 701), (u'back', 674), (u'fuck', 671), (u'eminem', 593), (u'go', 557), (u'see', 514), (u'one', 497), (u'say', 476), (u'never', 430), (u'bitch', 428), (u'man', 428), (u'let', 422), (u'time', 411), (u'come', 392), (u'think', 361)] And yeah apparently Eminem has cursed a lot in his songs. As you can see in the plot below for the word "shit" (rank:4), "fuck" (rank:8), "bitch" (rank:15). [caption id="attachment_2246" align="alignnone" width="800"] Frequency of top 20 words[/caption] Then the word 'love' has been used 282 times just bit less than the word 'ass' which was used 295 times. You can see the word 'dre' has been used a lot and it's most likely Dr. Dre who worked with Eminem. The word 'man' is used more than the word 'girl'. The word 'hate' is used less than the word 'love', only 116 times. Here's two more plots for word frequency. [caption id="attachment_2228" align="alignnone" width="800"] Frequency of top 50 words[/caption] [caption id="attachment_2229" align="alignnone" width="1502"] Frequency of top 100 words[/caption] Anyway, simple bag of words probably don't give good representation of a particular song. For example, the word love can be used in a sentence "I love you" but then also "I don't love you" which has completely opposite meaning. But here they are counted all together. Before contextual analysis, I was just thinking about doing another frequency analysis according to Russel's model of mood. You basically divide the xy-plane into four orthogonal regions as you can see in the image below. [caption id="attachment_2257" align="aligncenter" width="481"] Model of mood[/caption] I want to see where eminem's music in general fall in this emotional plane. There's more interesting analysis I can do later on using word vector and other new NLP techniques. I'll eventually look into other artists, other genres and try to find whether there are different patterns in how the words are chosen and the kind of emotion certain songs may generate.

Title: Exciting Days to come

Content:
I woke up at the middle of the night and am just thinking. Sometimes I hate when I can not stop thinking, but then sometimes thinking is fun as new ideas pop up. My friend Zak convinced me to stay in Chicago another day. It was a fun weekend. I met another of my friend too. Because Zac drives Uber in Chicago, I could see the city better than ever. The city in the evening is very colorful and dreamy. There's a lot of museums that I'd like to visit later on. I also made some new friends. I really would love to live in Chicago if given opportunity. But then I haven't seen so many places yet. I met Zak's friend whom he met through his exchange program in Denmark. She is really interesting and fun to be around. But the thing that striked me is that, she is german, doing her intern in a company in Chicago,  already travelled to Mexico, now going to SF, then to Vegas, then to Costa Rica, to Mexico, to Cuba, then to Madrid, then back to Germany. Then on last Friday, I met a new friend while having dinner at an Egyptian restaurant back in West Lafayette. She has already traveled India, the next country to mine before me, and advised me to go to all these places she liked like Rajsthan, Bombay etc. I meet these people and I wonder that I haven't done any of these. The last two years were so dark, morbid for me that I forgot to live. Anyway, I'm just going through a lot of realization how I got stuck in small thinkings, how I just always worry about what other people will think, how spiral life had become and how interesting I can make my life if I want and work for it, so many things I wanted to do, want to do, travel, I am feeling like I want to live again. I did those my entire life, I was exuberant. All that take is the desire to explore and I hate to say that all these worries, anxieties, hurt feelings just take the dreams and desires away. I still don't know how to swim well, I want to do scuba diving, snow boarding, I wanted to learn surfing this summer but I couldn't make it, I want to improve my Latin dancing, I want to learn spanish. After living so close from Chicago and Indiana, I didn't know that there's such beautiful beaches nearby. There's just so many things near me I don't know because I just don't always try to reach outside, talk to the person sitting next to me. I just never want to get stuck again, feel less confident about myself, feel burdened, feel the meaninglessness of life, rather I want to create and be adventurous as I always used to be, strive to see things, learn and grow. I'm just so happy that I made this trip. And I deeply felt what it means by the words "You just can not fathom things about outside, even about yourself unless you get out of your nest."

Last weekend I was bored. I was super bored, up to a level that I was literally trying to escape from everything. This weekend I am feeling really good. It's really nice weather outside here. I am in the new Starbucks coffeeshop near our campus. I love the new atmosphere in this coffee shop. The old one was really small and congested, the new one is wide and feels having more room. It's interesting how space makes us feel. The feeling of wideness and narrowness I mean! And I am thinking about ups and downs of life. May be I have some obsession with playing with my feelings ;). The ups and downs are so common, but still every time you are in the down side, you hate being there. On the other hand, the ups are the ones you want to sustain. How to really get used to with your failures? Some failures are just hard to accept as you firmly believe that you could have done better. It's that your laziness and lack of conscious thoughts in the moment just ruined it for you. But then no physical event should really define your potential, but it's just hard to reconcile. My friend Adil gave me a book. It's "The Prophet" by Kahlil Gibran. Reading Gibran is such a delight. I am reading page 29 on Joy and Sorrow. The chapter starts with Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow. And he answered: Your joy is your sorrow unmasked. There really is no hard line between joy and sorrow. But as human being, we know we feel; We feel joy and we feel sorrow. And we don't want sorrow for ourselves, we only want joy. Because it just feels good being joyous. But the natural world, the unconscious everything doesn't have the least concern about how we feel, what we want. Should we call the nature ruthless then because it doesn't care us at all? So, it's on us how we can feel, what we can feel. But feeling the power within yourself is not that easy. Well, that doesn't mean it's impossible. The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain. Frankly I have a feeling that I understand this sentence, but do I really? I am doubtful, may be because you can never appropriately measure the depth of your sorrow or your joy. When you are in misery, like when you lose your closest one, or you fail in something you deeply desired for, the sorrow just feels endless, when you are in the joyous state, like making love with your sweetest one, like sitting beside your mother and listen how you used to be when you were young with some disbelief, the joy you feel is just unimaginable. Every time it's new, because it's a new moment. Is not the cup that holds your wine the vey cup that was burned in the potter's oven?And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives? When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight. Gibran talks about how inseparable joy and sorrow is. He denies the superiority of one over the other. He brings some metaphor like a cup or a lute and how they stand with both of the sides- the harsh and the mild. He asks us to be introspective, to see our heart like a dual being observing its other self standing nearby. We are always thinking. And if I look at my own thoughts, they are so sporadic. It takes some effort to linearize my thoughts. It requires concentration to steadily and critically think about a single topic. It may be a very important neuro - scientific question why and how we evolved to be like this. A broad answer may be that millions of our early evolutionary past, all we thought and cared about is our survival in the wild. But were we not more focussed than what we are now? What I mean is - when you are running away from a danger or chasing down an animal or heavy lifting or climbing, those normally require intense focus. It can easily be said that when we didn't know how to read or write, those were our primary activities. Did we then used to live in the present more than how we live our life now? In our modern lives (last few centuries) through urbanization, through industrial, scientific, academic revolution, we brought more stability in managing our resources, properties. We live more in our mind now that we live outside I guess. But this is a big claim? Isn't it? And probably it's just not very easy to prove it. Our modern activities have changed, moved from high physical labor to low physical labor tasks, require more mental activities, because we learnt through imagination we can touch the infinite. It's a huge dilemma, isn't it? If I understand the mechanism of joy and sorrow, I know that these emotion are deeply attached with your connection with your presence in the world. But then we know that only through imagination, prediction of future and inference of the past, we can enjoy the unknowns. Both are true and so is the struggle in the mind. I will just end with the last sentence in the chapter by Gibran. When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall. And I am now watching this to add more spice to my burning mind-oven. https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness?utm_campaign=tedspread--b&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare https://www.ted.com/talks/helen_pearson_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_human_development?utm_source=newsletter_weekly_2017-10-07&utm_campaign=newsletter_weekly&utm_medium=email&utm_content=talk_of_the_week_image

I am thinking about writing my experiences overseas. All the different choices that I have made over time, choices that brought good and bad outcomes in my life. It would be nice if I can write those like a story being told. I feel like I have lots of stories to tell. Some stories may be inspiring, some may be dull. There are things that happened to me that I would like to describe. I wonder whether I still remember a lot of details of past times. It's probably hard to remember some of the specific feelings that I experienced in the past. But I should try. I learnt a lot from the people I met, through the events I was exposed to. Some events definitely changed me as a person. I would like to rethink those if possible. What were those really that I tried to accomplish by getting involved in various things? I feel like to re-explore my own past explorations, do some self-reflections. How did I happen to desire certain things, how did I become an ambitious individual? How did I gain the courage of risking things? There were so many people I met that I no longer have connection. There are people that I still keep connection. The strengthening and weakening of relationship with people is indeed a strange thing. Not all of them were conscious choices, some just happened. I would like to write about the economic hardships, the emotional turmoils and how I have or have not overcome some of those. There are stories to write about my spiritual journey, thoughts about how I felt distance from religious doctrines, how certain knowledge have inspired me to do so. Hope I can start writing soon. I just had coffee in a coffee-shop near the campus. I randomly looked for a book to read and found Richard Henry Dana, JR.'s "Two years before the mast" and started reading the introduction. Actually after knowing Dana's personal struggle and choices, my desire to write about my own experiences escalated. Dana subjected himself to a marine sailor life to see the laborious life, to see the harshness. In some way, I might have also done the same. However, when I left home, I had no clue how hard it would turn out. I probably didn't subject myself to the harshness, but I subjected myself to uncertainty, to unknowns. May be when I finish reading this book, I will gain some different perspective on my own experiences. This is one quote I liked from the introduction of the book - "Twenty-four years after. How softening is the effect of time! It touches us through the affections. I almost feel as if I were lamenting the passing away of something loved and dear - the boats, the Kanaksas, the hides, my old shipmates! Death, change, distance, lend them a character which makes them quite another thing from the vulgar, wearisome toil of uninteresting, forced manual labor."

Title: What are those Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies anyway?
Published Date: Tue, 26 Dec 2017 14:10:59 +0000
Categories & Tags: Blockchain, CoderMind, Home, Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, freedom, investment, Money, security
Content:
Little Background for specially those who are new to the world of cryptocurrency: What is Bitcoin? - A digital currency which keeps its registry book on the web in the files called block which creates a chain called blockchain and which is not governed/controlled by any third party. Your money is your money, you own it and you solely control it. If you have ever downloaded or streamed movie online using P2P service, Bitcoin is basically using similar system to generate money/coins and store transaction information worldwide. Where is the value of Bitcoin? - Well, this is difficult to answer. Because value of something is in the eye of the person who is judging. Where is the value of a flower like rose? What is the value of a painting by Picasso? What is the value of a paper which says 10 dollar or 10 rupi and then the name of the government, which we call cash that we keep in our wallet that we use in restaurants? - Where does a paper get a value? What's the value of a PhD certificate? What's the value of any paper that you can torn down in second? So... there is no value if you or significant portion of the population don't give it a value. And in a society, we build trust, we maintain relationship (social/financial) to create value. I can ramble on Value day long but I hope you get it through the analogy. Bitcoin and other crypto currency project will thus have value if a lot of people trust in it and use it because it make life/business easier, bring new idea to the world. Why does it called cryptocurrency? - Because online security depends on cryptography (a field of computer science and security) and cryptographic proofs/protocols. How many cryptocurrencies are there? - More than 3000. Why? - Coz Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrency's codes are open source, so anybody, even you just can copy it and create your own coin if you know programming. Therefore, most of the crypto-currencies can not be trusted and we need to have cautious eyes. Which are some of the reliable currencies? - The top 100 crypto currency from coin market cap can be taken seriously. https://coinmarketcap.com/ What should I look at when I look at these crypto coins? - How long they survived, how is the total market capital, how much is the 24 hour volumes(how much trade is happening every day), who is behind that currency? Why should I buy in? - Simple answer, if you want to make good investment, there is a lot of opportunities in crypto currency space. Why do you think so? Lots of crypto currency projects are very innovative legitimate startups backed by big institutions which are trying to solve real world problems like how to lend money in Africa, how to deal with inflation in Argentina, how to send money 24/7 at any point to another point across the world, how to reduce the power of central governments, how to use distributed web to reduce costs? The bottom line is this space is just like internet back in 90s, only few people knew and had information. So, if you have the correct information and challenging mindset and invest into the right project, you can get rich, a millionaire, billionaire or a trillionaire. But if you are stupid, you can lose your life savings, get hacked and that's why you need right and valuable information. So, no risk, no gain. Just imagine, if you would have invested in Facebook back in 2000, you would be so happy today, isn't it? Because if you are reading this, you are on facebook that didn't exist before 2000. Okay, I understand Bitcoin but what is the purpose of other cryptocurrencies? Type 1- Money: Firstly, What does Bitcoin do? It keeps a registry book of information about who bought or sold what to whom at what time and where? Banks make money by giving you credit/debit card and maintaining these information, but Bitcoin keeps them securely on the web in a system called Blockchain. Okay, you got the basics then. Now, there's a lot of clones, like how many languages in this world- english, spanish, bengali... I can't count. But as you know with all these different languages, everywhere we just express our thoughts and feelings and imaginations. So, every language comes with its own flavor, grammar, scripts but fundamentally they are a medium of exchanging information from one to other.. Therefore, Bitcoin also have variants, thousands of other coins cloned from bitcoin. Just like I love Japanese, but my friend like Chinese, people also like one crypto over other for their own flavor or business association. Name some coin: Litecoin, Peercoin, Prime coin, Dogecoin etc. Type 2- Smart Ideas/Business (Wide bracket): Now, some other people thought, wait.. why only the information of buying or selling goods.. How about I keep legal documents like my home ownership, my car deals, my copyrights, other contracts using similar distributed blockchain Bitcoin use. Right now we use lawyers, government registries- trusted authorities to take care of them. That's when the idea of smart contract arose. Using cryptography, it's possible to keep these information (partially or full) on the web securely in a way so that only you or relevant people will be able to open. So, this is how other crypto-currency ideas are born. The second biggest cryptocurrency Ethereum is basically smart contract. Ethereum itself has a programming platform, it's kind of like Apple App store or Google Play store for android, where developers submit apps based on their cool ideas. So, in short, Ethereum, the second biggest crypto coin provides a platform where other crypto based innovative coins/ projects can be hosted. What are some cool projects? - Distributed matchmaking, distributed social network like facebook, distributed crowdfunding, you name it.. just like how many apps are there on App store? If there is a legitimate service you can come up with and you know that there's a market for it, you can create a coin. Business 101. Name some other cryptos: Qtum, Omisego, Cardano, Neo, Nxt, Nem. https://coinmarketcap.com Type 3 (Privacy Coin): Now this is where it becomes very very mathematical. Bitcoin, ethereum these are not private. What does it mean by private? Meaning, what if I want to hide my information, I don't want hackers, government to track where I spent money, how much I sent someone in India? Oh.. you didn't know that you have been tracked? Did you? Well, now you should know then.. that every time you swap your credit card, every time you buy a ticket, every time you make a phone call, your government, authorities have the ability to know where you are, what you are eating, with whom you are hanging out, how much money you have and they can then tax it? Well, if you are an honest good person doing no bad, you probably don't care? Or do you? I hope you have heard the arguments of Edward Snowden. Well, anyway, if you are not an anarchist or a social reformer or a libertarian or whatever.. you probably don't care. But those people care about their privacy. So, how do you hide your ip address, how do you mask your money? That's where comes the power of mathematics, that's where comes the use of Privacy coins. So, what are some privacy coins out there? - Monero, Zcash, Zcoin, Verge. In fact, you should buy Verge now. There are also other types of coins which try to improve obscure technical limitations of other coins. 2018 is coming. Join our Facebook Group to learn more: Blockchain/Bitcoin SCET (Science, Crypto, Econ & Tech) Thinkers “This is a group for anyone interested in Science, Research, Finance, IT, Decentralization, Democracy with the use of Blockchain technology. Bitcoin and other prominent crypto-currency provide it all. Bitcoin and crypto-currencies with the revolutionary blockchain technology gifted us decentralized money, smart contract, financial instruments accessible by everybody from everywhere. The success of decentralization in Bitcoin/Crypto space showed us the power of consensus based mechanisms and systems which can solve problems in various arena of our society. This group/meetup will try to provide a platform for enthusiasts to share ideas, brain storm and understand better about the new Crypto world. We are primarily located around three universities in the midwest: Purdue University(PU), University of Illinois Urbana Champaign(UIUC), Indiana University(IU) but we welcome everybody interested. But we want our user to be active participant rather than to be passive observers. Please join, learn and share your views with us. " So, the sole purpose of this group is to share information and be smart and probably be rich if you want to. But we don't like rich, arrogant, assholes, so you need to be polite and intelligent.

Title: Being touched in the heart

I recently got introduced to turkish music by a friend. Some of the songs are really good. For me, lyrics are important and that's why if I like the music of a song, I naturally look up whether a translation exists or ask a friend who knows the meaning of the words. There's these two artists I like now - one is "Pinhani" and "Emre Ayden". Their voice really touches my heart. I would like to share Pinhani's "Nehirler Durmaz". https://open.spotify.com/track/05BUnCEC1Cn4A8yeCA5yzi Birazdan güneş doğacak Sun will rise soon Açacak çiçek sana sormadan The flower will bloom without asking you Birazdan gün başlayacak The day will start soon Saatin çalacak hiç utanmadan Your clock will go off without shame Oysa sen bir nehirsin But you are a river Ve nehirler durmaz And rivers don't stop Kavuşur bir an önce sevdiğine They rejoin with the one they love Asla geç kalmaz They are never late İstesen gelebilirsin If you want, you can come Yola çıkmadan olmaz Not before to hitting road Sabah olmadan gelsen bile Even if you come before morning Ellerim sen olmadan ısınmaz My hands can't warm without you Birazdan gece son bulacak The night will be end soon Kaçacak uykun ardına bakmadan You'll lose your sleep without looking back Birazdan yollar dolacak The roads will be crowded soon This song includes all these natural scenes that take me to these beautiful places where I can imagine to walk, even touch and feel content. How the river is used as a metaphor is also quite interesting, how the flow of water diverges, converges makes me roll in to the deep - that quite fits into how a life goes by I assume. And the next song is Emre Aydin's "Ses Ver". https://open.spotify.com/track/1u4gf6HnALF0oJ3LUSUL1v Duvarlar ördüm, köprüler yıktım I put up walls, pull down bridges Döndüm bir baktım, hiçbir şeyi unutmamışım I looked back, I haven't forgotten anything Eğer her şey bitiyorsa bitsin artık yokluğunda If everything ends let it already end in your abscence Eğer her şey bitiyorsa, beni bırakma burada If everything ends, don't leave me here Çocuklar toplanıp gittiler The children came together and went away from my soul Dünle unutmak arasındayım şimdi Now, I'm between yesterday and forgetting Sen yoksun inan, bir tek sen lazımken Believe me, you are absent when all I need you Bir ses ver, yapma, burada bırakma bizi Give out a sound, don't, don't leave a mark Çocuklar toplanıp gittiler içimden The kids came together and went away from my soul Dünle unutmak arasındayım şimdi Now, I'm between yesterday and forgetting Sen yoksun inan, bir tek sen lazımken Believe me, you are absent when all I need you Bir ses ver, yapma, burada bırakma bizi Give out a sound, don't, don't leave a mark ses ver Give out a sound ses ver Give out a sound Yeminler ettim ve çok konuştum I swore, I talked a lot of Döndüm bir baktım, hiçbir şey söylememişim I looked back, I haven't said anything Eğer her şey bitiyorsa bitsin artık yokluğunda If everything ends let it already end in your abscence I like the poetry in these two songs. The remembering, the forgetting, the presence, the absence all make sense to me in quite a vivid way. "If everything ends let it already end in your abscence"- it may be the absence of a person - a loved one, but I can treat it also as the absence of something more abstract or materialistic that used to be close, that used to be a part of myself. Just giving out a sound, coz inside it's so chaotic that you sometimes feel not to express, but you should shout. Looking back, you could have done otherwise, everything shall pass. I also like some turkish rap. I think Ceza is probably the most popular and I like the song "Suspus". https://open.spotify.com/track/1JvUmKSl9Mg6mQnmbjLYyz Göz gözü görmüyor hep pus No one can see each others, it's all haze Takipteler ses etme sus They're following, don't make sound, shush Bir vakit donmuştu beynim My brain has freezed once Düzlükteyken bitmiş seyrim My journey has ended on the level Göz gözü görmüyor hep pus No one can see each others, it's all haze Takipteler ses etme sus They're following, don't make sound, shush Durma git enerjini kus Go ahead and discharge your energy Zaten çok soğuk etraf buz It is already too cold, freezing Hiç yalan der misin a ah Do you tell lies? no.. Pek dert dinler misin a ah Do you listen to others troubles? no.. Ya bayat yer misin a ah Do you eat stale? no.. İnsan seçer misin a ah Do you discriminate people? no.. Dikkatli izlersen anlarsın haklı megatron If you pay attention, you'll see that Megatron is right Bende ghillie kevlar-mythril, sende sade bir kat krom I have a Ghillie Kevlar-mythril, you have only one layer of chromium Zaten tekim, çıplak gezsem n'olur, her gün dekatlon I'm a lone ranger, what happens if I walk naked, everyday is another decathlon Hep dikenli tel etrafımda, kendi kendimeyim her gün sor bir Barbed wire all around me, I'm on my own everyday, ask me one time Hep diken diken gel bir gör It's all barb, come and see one time Tıkandı kaldı bak her bir form Look, every form is choked up Kırıntıların arasında kaldım, adı konsun artık I stayed between crumbs, it needs a name now Hadi konsomatrisim ol, her sokakta beni bulmak zor Let's be my B-girl, it's hard to find me in every on streets Sıkılanlardan mısın ya da ıkınanlardan mısın? Are you from the bored ones or stretched ones? Kulağına dandik müzik takılanlardansın You are from the ones wear dud music in their ears. Ama kusura bakma yapılacak hiçbir şey yok Sorry but there's nothing to do. Hızlı söyleyen ben değilim yavaş dinleyen sizlersiniz hep I'm not fast, you are the one listening too slow always Yavaş söylesem anlayacakmış gibi konuşuyor, şuna baksana kek Look at that fool, he is talking like he'd understand if I speak slowly Altına bez, al sana test, iki kere iki Ceza eder net Here a napkin for you, here a test for you, two times two equal Ceza, yes Birikiminiz ile bir bardak bile dolmaz, öğrenebildin mi veled? Your savings cannot fill up even a glass, haven't you learnt that, you brat? Rap harekettir ve de politiktir Rap is the motion and it is political Bunu hazmedemiyor isen hassiktir Fuck off, if you can't swallow it Duvarda hit-list, çoğunuz misfit On the wall hit-list, many of you are misfits Karalarım her yeri sen gene hit this I scratch everywhere, you is again "hit this" Bilmiyorsan sus, yaralara tuz bas, karalara ayak ile herkese Shut up if you don't know, press salt in the wounds, Kumpas kur bak, uzaktan head shot.Zaten… Machinate to everyone, look, head shot from far away. Already Göz gözü görmüyor hep pus No one can see each others, it's all haze Takipteler ses etme sus They're following, don't make sound, shush Bir vakit donmuştu beynim My brain has freezed once Düzlükteyken bitmiş seyrim My journey has ended on the level Göz gözü görmüyor hep pus No one can see each others, it's all haze Takipteler ses etme sus They're following, don't make sound, shush Ceza's voice in this song gives me strength. I think this song talks about the fuzzy nature in our society where we are all shielded, confused about our journey of life. But in the end, he recommends to say "Fuck off" to all bullshits because every form is choked up and you should discharge everything you got.

Title: On Living - A poem shared by a friend

A poem by Nazim Hikmet from turkey shared by a Turkish friend. And I said to my friend "I like how it gives me a sense of purpose and the meaning in living and the desire to live more seriously." So, feeling to share.. About the poet Nazim Hikmet Nazim Hikmet was born on January 15, 1902 in Salonika, Ottoman Empire (now Thessaloníki, Greece), where his father served in the Foreign Service. He was exposed to poetry at an early age through his artist mother and poet grandfather, and had his first poems published when he was seventeen. Raised in Istanbul, Hikmet left Allied-occupied Turkey after the First World War and ended up in Moscow, where he attended the university and met writers and artists from all over the world. After the Turkish Independence in 1924 he returned to Turkey, but was soon arrested for working on a leftist magazine. He managed to escape to Russia, where he continued to write plays and poems. And the poem: On Living Nazim Hikmet, 1902 - 1963 I Living is no laughing matter: you must live with great seriousness like a squirrel, for example— I mean without looking for something beyond and above living, I mean living must be your whole occupation. Living is no laughing matter: you must take it seriously, so much so and to such a degree that, for example, your hands tied behind your back, your back to the wall, or else in a laboratory in your white coat and safety glasses, you can die for people— even for people whose faces you’ve never seen, even though you know living is the most real, the most beautiful thing. I mean, you must take living so seriously that even at seventy, for example, you’ll plant olive trees— and not for your children, either, but because although you fear death you don’t believe it, because living, I mean, weighs heavier. II Let’s say we’re seriously ill, need surgery— which is to say we might not get up from the white table. Even though it’s impossible not to feel sad about going a little too soon, we’ll still laugh at the jokes being told, we’ll look out the window to see if it’s raining, or still wait anxiously for the latest newscast. . . Let’s say we’re at the front— for something worth fighting for, say. There, in the first offensive, on that very day, we might fall on our face, dead. We’ll know this with a curious anger, but we’ll still worry ourselves to death about the outcome of the war, which could last years. Let’s say we’re in prison and close to fifty, and we have eighteen more years, say, before the iron doors will open. We’ll still live with the outside, with its people and animals, struggle and wind— I mean with the outside beyond the walls. I mean, however and wherever we are, we must live as if we will never die. III This earth will grow cold, a star among stars and one of the smallest, a gilded mote on blue velvet— I mean this, our great earth. This earth will grow cold one day, not like a block of ice or a dead cloud even but like an empty walnut it will roll along in pitch-black space . . . You must grieve for this right now —you have to feel this sorrow now— for the world must be loved this much if you’re going to say “I lived”. . .

I wish I had realized this early in my life. I was reading this: "If they have to be chased, then they don’t want you. And if they don’t want you, then you shouldn’t want them . As Maya Angelou says, “When people show you who they are, believe them the first time.” If someone, be it potential friend, wife, business partner, is showing you that they would rather not get along with you, believe them. Be confident and live."" I personally feel like literally everyone, at one point or other in their life, intensely feels the fear of being left out, be it in a broken relationship, be it rejected by a job interview, be it get fired, be it not being able to achieve something very desirable, be a friend mistreating, be your parents being horrible with you. The fear, the loneliness eats the soul, takes us to the darkest corner to hate living. I realize now it's all for good ultimately. Being challenging and resilient truly takes time and you need to fail to learn. But boy, it's so hard to keep your sanity sometimes. "This cannot be said enough. Imagine you walked into a car dealership and the salesman told you he had a car for you. He says, "Well, it's kinda old and beat up. It still runs, but it's high on gas, there's a few scratches on the paint, and I'm not sure how reliable it is." Now, how much would you want to buy that car? You'd be out of there in a New York second and looking for something better in no time, I'm quite sure. Why? Because if the person selling you the car doesn't even believe in the quality of the car, why should you? This is exactly why you need to increase your confidence and self-esteem. If you don't believe in what you are selling, then why should others? Confidence is attractive. If you believe you have something valuable to offer, so will others. The more you truly love yourself, the more convinced you'll be that you will find right things for you. " --- From a pairedlife.com post Realize what you can offer.

Content:
It's 2018. The first book to try to formulate probability/chance was by Abraham de Moivre in exactly 300 years ago in 1718. If you roll two dices, can you get two numbers that sum to 14? No. Coz the maximum number in each dice is 6. But can you get a number 11? Yes. That's probable. How much probable? Can we measure? These are some basic probability that every science student learns in high school. But the underlying philosophy here is striking: "Not everything is equally probable. Some are more likely than others. Some arguments, ideas are better than others, but based on some established ideas or agreed upon assumptions. How do we measure?" What are your chances of waking up tomorrow? Is it 100%? What's the chance that your relationship will last? Are these even measurable? What does it mean when you say I hope? Does that automatically translate into a highly probable future? Why don't you get that million dollar lottery? Can you win some bucks at those Vegas gambling playing poker or blackjack? ;) What's your chance that you will win the game? It wasn't that easy for mathematicians and statisticians to formulate what it really means by what's probable,what's expected in the world of uncertainty we live in and deal with. And in science, who doesn't deal with some basic probability equations in their data. . https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9081462-the-doctrine-of-chances I absolutely admire the talk by Dr. Ana at Lawrence Livermore National Lab on "Understanding the world through statistics." who introduced me to this book. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUO2LgSFsws "The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play around everyone's backyard." - The great statistician John Tukey. May be I can make a new phrase for CS programmer too..haha. "The best thing about being a computer programmer is that you get to make toys for everyone." LoL.

Title: Software is eating the world
Published Date: Tue, 30 Jan 2018 07:52:09 +0000

Content:
It's past midnight. And I just realized how I depend on softwares literally my every awakening moment. And I googled how many people feel the same way. And here it is.. "Software is eating the world." You see how this sentence scares our feelings. If I would use the word "improving/enhancing" instead of "eating/devouring", you would have imagined things differently. Words can misconstrue and mislead. And here it gets more spooky on artmusicdance if you have time to read -- My Speculations About Reality- Really Speculative! http://www.artmusicdance.com/vaspi/pythagoras.htm I think freedom of choice is the most important thing over anything else. So, if everything we do is to live the way we want and if we are always trying to seek for something better for our lives towards the goal of perfection, and if on a positive note, we continue building software for the betterment of our lives and society, we will be software driven. May be in a more radical sense, we can say that we ourselves are gonna be part of softwares, though I guess everybody hates these type of ideas, connotations because of the scifi transformer type movies, where anything mechanical is non-spiritual and thus non-humane, thus undesirable. We have these feeling of separation from things that's logical, that's mechanical from things which are spiritual, illogical, irrational - even though our whole consciousness basically rely on both at the same time. But anyway, our ideas are ever evolving I guess about what kind of world we want to live in. It's not that we know everything or we can know everything, but we try. And as far as I can see, there will be softwares everywhere, inside and outside, more and more. Like money is turning into software based, software generated, virtual. The friction we have about whether it should be accepted or not can link towards very much psychological, philosophical questions like what's the value of your memories? In far far future, will you pay for a software which can help you regain some memory that you lost but you want to regain? What if we come up with technologies with which it's possible to store our brain and thus choose different physical bodies, will we call ourselves software, will we coin some new term? When the general artificial intelligence will be capable of giving birth to seemingly sentient robots which can have human like conversation with you, with whom you can form better bond or friendship than with your neighbour, will you call psychologically matured, software driven, human-like robots your friend? The world we, the human species if we exist, are gonna live years from now is not going to be the same world as it is now, like it was not the same, rather was quite different 500 years ago in terms of standards and morality. But I do believe that some basic ideas of life and morality and culture probably won't change, but how we express and exhibit may change very much along with every other changes that I can not fathom right now. Now why is that relevant to you? That's a good question to ponder on. Only if you want to!! Haha. So I will quote legendary Investor Andressen: http://lingualeo.com/es/jungle/why-software-is-eating-the-world-marc-andreessen-wall-street-journal-131474#/page/1 """More than 10 years after the peak of the 1990s dot-com bubble, a dozen or so new Internet companies like Facebook and Twitter are sparking controversy in Silicon Valley, due to their rapidly growing private market valuations, and even the occasional successful IPO. With scars from the heyday of Webvan and Pets.com still fresh in the investor psyche, people are asking, "Isn't this just a dangerous new bubble?" I, along with others, have been arguing the other side of the case. (I am co-founder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen-Horowitz, which has invested in Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Twitter, Zynga, and Foursquare, among others. I am also personally an investor in LinkedIn.) We believe that many of the prominent new Internet companies are building real, high-growth, high-margin, highly defensible businesses. Today's stock market actually hates technology, as shown by all-time low price/earnings ratios for major public technology companies. Apple, for example, has a P/E ratio of around 15.2 — about the same as the broader stock market, despite Apple's immense profitability and dominant market position (Apple in the last couple weeks became the biggest company in America, judged by market capitalization, surpassing Exxon Mobil). And, perhaps most telling, you can't have a bubble when people are constantly screaming "Bubble!" But too much of the debate is still around financial valuation, as opposed to the underlying intrinsic value of the best of Silicon Valley's new companies. My own theory is that we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy.

Learning about the Bengal basin for one of my earth science project. It's great to clearly know now how the big delta has been formed through Assam basin to Bengal to Himalayas. The formation of the rocks and rivers made my small, beautiful country so green and fertile and full of resources like natural gas and potentially oil in the north-east side. The biggest mangrove forest in the south which is facing great struggle. Studying tectonic plate movements are fundamental to figure out about earth quakes and natural hazards like floods etc. which kill hundreds of people every year. Unfortunately there's so much lack of knowledge and expertise for evaluating our resources and further extract to grow our economy. We are forced to rely on foreign expertise and be tricked all the time. And also the preservation of wild life and forests are so necessary that people don't recognize. And the good old corruption and incompetence everywhere is just insane. I probably would have never learnt the importance of geographical studies on a nation's economy if I wouldn't pursue earth science now, so I feel like a great deficiency in how we teach the next generations about our own geography and diversity. Lots to be done to spread information and make people value what we have and stop complaining about what we don't have! Today my younger brother in junior school was asking me if everyone can buy question papers for examinations (which has plagued Bangladeshi education system) to get good grades, why should he study the whole year? I had to explain him the value of knowledge and tell him why he shouldn't be like another corrupt student. It's so saddening ! Hope I can still be optimistic amidst everything sad. http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bengal_Basin

Sometimes I have a grim view towards life when I see the pain, selfishness and suffering everywhere. May be our suffering emerges from the simple view that we like to think ourselves as the center of universe. Some sufferings are truly unnecessary, unjust and should and will be eradicated. As every experience is subjective, it's difficult to wrap your head around a lot of complex, sometimes narcissistic ideas. I personally am spiritual but sometimes can't stand against the spiritual bullshits. So, I become hopeless when I am tired and feel to give up. But as long as kids from all color, race and background co-exist who are driven to change the world for everyone, I should not lose hope for humanity. Life can be better as long as we strive for it. Compassion and altruism is a win for you-win for others position, but selfishness is a win for you-loss for others position. It's not very hard for me to choose between these two paths. The World’s 50 Smartest Teenagers https://thebestschools.org/features/worlds-50-smartest-teenagers/ And I'd probably change the headline of the article from "smartest" to "compassionate". Coz human seems to be motivated to do phenomenal things when they see good purpose.

Title: Bitcoin - how it was perceived in 2013?

A talk from 2013 at TED(Technlogy, Entertainment and Design). Watch the talk, and think what is different in the talk in 2013 from what it is now in 2018 after nearly 5 years. Enjoy! Around the time, I first heard about bitcoin and got mind blown when I realized it could potentially give birth to a global currency. I'm lucky to find the talk for you all again, while exploring the TED talks. Even though Bitcoin was born with the dream of being a global curerncy, however, now a days, it's mainly being treated as a digital gold or asset where you invest your money with the hope for making profit. But when I knew about Bitcoin, I didn't get excited by it's profit-making ability, rather, I was excited by how a currency can be established without the authority of any government by simply using some mathematics, cryptography and algorithms. The beauty of mathematics and the power of internet mesmerized me in significant way and I started learning more. Since then, it has evolved so much, it has experienced so much, it's been popularized all around the world, criminalized in countries, stolen, hacked and what not ! So, it may not turn into a currency. Who will buy his coffee today with 0.00036 BTC(~ 3 USD) which may be 360 USD (when 1 BTC ~ 1,000,000 USD) ? It sounds foolish. But trust me I have bought my dinner in an Indian restaurant named Khana Khazana in West Lafayette with bitcoin which will be worth more than that in 2020. I don't regret it, because I didn't care, what will be it's value in future, rather that I and the fellow bitcoiners were more excited to be able to use bitcoin to buy our food. So, may be, not bitcoin, but some other crypto currency will be a global coin. Governments will now create their own crypto coin(https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/30/cryptocurrency-craze-springboards-government-backed-coin.html). But however the future will be, it's gonna be an interesting one in terms of how we will use our money. When something is exciting, you can always smell it when you play with it, and this video just reminded me of my memories. Hope when I am old, I can say to my grandchildren that I was part of a monetary revolution. https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_kemp_robertson_bitcoin_sweat_tide_meet_the_future_of_branded_currency#t-396554

You will realize the significance level of the top 7 cryptocurrency if you look at this chart. 1. Bitcoin: BTC (Yellow dotted curve) 2. Ethereum: ETH (Blue dotted curve) 3. Litecoin: LTC (Aliceblue dotted curve) 4. Ripple: XMR (Orange dotted curve) 5. Cardano: ADA ( Brown dotted curve) 6. Stellar Lumen: XLM (Light green dotted curve) 7. Monero: XMR (Pink dotted curve) This chart shows you the price of these 7 major crypto coins from September till now. If you look at the pink rectangle, you can realize how Ethereum(dark blue), Monero(pink), Litecoin(alice blue), Stellar(Light green) has higher price than bitcoin (yellow). But, they were not always higher, look during november, everything was less valued than bitcoin (yellow curve is at the top in Nov 2017). As Bitcoin's price had an upward trend during the end of december, all the coin price also saw upward trend. But as Bitcoin's price is going down, some coins are holding their value but some are losing their value. You can see, underneath the pink rectangle, falls the two coin Cardano(brown) and Ripple(Orange), these two coins are losing their value. However, Ripple had higher values in early January as you can see if you look at the last peak for all coins near Jan 2018. I never had too much confidence in Ripple as it somehow defeats the idea of crypto currency with its centralized feature (But who knows it may see light again if it can deliver its promises). Ultimately, money will flock to services which have higher utility and can gain trust. So, these should give you some rough idea about the coin dynamics. A successful coin economy depends on how the market share or daily volume of trade is going on that coin landscape. It's kind of similar to how Forex (Foreign Exchange market) market where currencies are traded moves, how US dollar influences Euro or Japanese Yen, or Chinese Renminbi, or Bangladeshi Taka. Hope you have an idea of evaluating crypto coins and their potential gains or losses over time and can make educated investment decisions. And I guess you can see how crypto exchange market is going to look like in future.

Don't like or even read this post, coz you can get killed by someone who might think you are a threat to their ideas!! For me, I rather die saying things that I feel right. I am gonna die anyway. It takes only a generation or two to make something come real. We probably don't see changes in our day to day life, but when we look over a span of years, you can see how things have changed in your life or in the life of a nation. A vivid example is soccer. Within a century, a form of sports can take over, can become the livelihood of millions. But it takes passion and effort for the beginners. Was just reading about soccer history in Spain as I am a La Liga fan and these thoughts are coming. My country came into existence when my mom was a teenager. Another example can be the mathematics olympiad across the world. Another example can be the whole jewish people and their achievement of Nobel prizes and domination in the world of finance. Our average life expectancy is around 70-80 and that's just enough to have so much difference, to see so many revolutions. Even the other sports like cricket. May be the strongest example is Internet itself and social media like Facebook. I just wonder how it will be different when I will be old. Time is so fluid. And time also had a beginning. It just doesn't make sense about talking about time before Big Bang, because time began with that bang. Who said we need super natural to have the purpose of our life? Just being a mere spectator of these cultural phenomenons sound enough for me to appreciate that I am alive. It's totally awesome that using this little round thing over my body called brain I can try to comprehend the earth, the universe and everything in between. Ain't it great? Do we really need heaven outside the realm of what's real and what can be beautiful? I felt so sad, so threatened with an attack on one of the biggest intellectual of our country. Frankly, I wouldn't be here trying to do science and dream my life if I were not inspired by Dr. Muhammad Zafar Iqbal (http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2018/03/04/attacked-zafar-iqbal-enemy-islam/) and look what this moron is saying "I attacked him because he is the enemy of Islam". This religious muslim dude doesn't feel like a man has the right to live, he doesn't feel like he is a fellow country man, he doesn't feel like that he has changed thousands of people's lives, inspired a whole generation of students. Yes, he is not perfect, he said and did things that you may not like. But for the sake of religion, you want to kill him. So easy it is to eliminate, my friend. Then there will be apologetics to say, "No, Islam is the religion of peace." Every religion is the religion of peace, according to your logic, why are you choosing one then? I have no problem of you choosing one, then why do you have problem for me being outside of it. If you can't convince me with your ideas, you have no right to stop me spreading the ideas I have. It should be free market of ideas. Well, probably not for you, coz this life is not important for you after all. So, you gotta kill everybody who says anything against you, so that you can ensure that Islam is the only valid idea. How sick religion can be? If you are peacefully religious I have nothing to say, coz I am peacefully non-religious. But when you want to take my life away, then there's a big problem. Isn't it? I feel scared how people want to kill other people in the name of God, how people threaten other people because they don't like certain ideas, how people get offended so easily, how merely some conversation gets you into fight, just feel so sad that people don't see the bigger picture? The idea in a religious mind that this world is not the ultimate, rather this is just a playing ground for something substantially larger after death according to some scripture, just can be terrifying. If you can't appreciate living this life, and are only thinking about what's coming after, you are not living in your present at all. Living in present is not living materialistically. You can not change anything with that mindset as this world is not important for you. How sick the idea of heaven and hell is? I have lost so many friends of mine who avoid me because I am an agnostic, there's a good amount of chance that I will be killed some day being vocal about it like some bloggers in my country living nightmarish life. I stopped talking, writing about these for a while, but sometimes it's just hard not to say things when events like these occur. We are so scared of religious fanatics. Interestingly I do pray several times a day, as islamic prayer for me is like transcendental vedic meditation to calm me, center me, I hanged out in hindu temples, I will probably go to Tibet with some friends to hang out with some buddhist monks, I read quran, bible, listen some religious soungs, because I appreciate the rhythm, the beauty and the words, the wiseness, the history but I can't believe literally everything that's been said in a pre-historic world. I am just simply open minded, I am open to the idea that I can be wrong, I can make mistakes because simply I am human and I can only know this much in my lifetime. There's so much that I don't know. I don't even invalidate the possibility of existence of a super natural almighty but merely realize that the probability of such existence in nearly zero presence of evidence is very low. And even if the big He exists, that just has nothing to do with these man made religions like Islam, Christianity and everything else with their own stories and dogmas. I believe, if anything, even with the smallest, smallest, tiniest probability of a God being existent, will not make any of his creation to suffer in hell, if he is all that powerful, he doesn't require us to worship, such a powerful existence requires nothing, he doesn't require to punish you by burning, even if he exists with again a miniscule probability. The idea of an angry God or Allah, a possessive, manipulative, personal God who wants you to live in a certain way, who looks at you through his firista or angels in every single moment, even when you are musterbating, is such a fanatic, sick and disturbing idea. And everybody who buys it with fear, I just sigh! But I will protect your right of doing whatever you want. You don't even need to listen to me if you don't want. But don't obstruct those who want to listen, please. Mindfulness is important but being deluded that this world is not important to change, to be happy, to not work for eliminating gender inequality, poverty, bigger issues because of some reward or punishment in after life, just sickens me. Resources are scarce and we compete to get a job, to find food, to find potential partners, but probably in the process we sometimes forget that it's not all about competition and corruption, it's about just living as best as you can, that doesn't have to bring suffering to another fellow human being. I am a vegan now, so I can extend that to even any fellow sentient living being, like animals, fish. Why will you want to inflict suffering on something that feels pain? What kind of sickness is that unless you require inflicting pain for your own survival like we had to when we were hunter gatherers, we were in extreme living conditions. We no longer need to inflict pain on a fellow human being and even on anything that feels pain to live a better healthy life, so let's not bring suffering to this world anymore. This world has seen enough suffering, it doesn't require more. How far are you from being a simple human being embracing everyone, making borders and walls between each other? I just hope we merely embrace life as it is, can see a bigger, beautiful picture and not be afraid of anything and be happy. Anything is achievable. Just live without delusion. Anyway, my thoughts have flown so far unexpectedly, back to the history of soccer in spain to cool down. --------------------------------------------------------------- "The origin of soccer is said to be in Western Europe. However, the exact place of its origin is disputed. England, France and Spain are the strong contenders. The honor of organizing the first Football Association, the first Football National team and the first set of common rules for the game of soccer all goes to England. Taking inspiration from the English, Spain formed their own soccer organization in 1909 and was named as Royal Spanish Football Federation. The preparation for the La Liga started in 1927, although the tournament was played in 1928. In the beginning, there were 10 teams, which were picked to play in the tournament. Most of them were former winners of the Copa del Rey, the Spanish cup, that outdates the La Liga in Spain. The clubs who went onto write the history of Spanish soccer were FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, Arenas Club de Getxo, Real Union, Real Sociedad, Athletic Bilbao, Atletico Aviacion (Atletico Madrid), RCD Espanyol, CE Europa and Racing Santander. Although the last four have never owned the Spanish cup, they were runner ups, therefore, they were granted place in the newly formed league. Facts Every town in Spain is known to have a football ground and team as well. Indoor football is played in various sports centers throughout the country. It is often said, that Spanish children learn to play football almost as soon as they learn to walk. Therefore, it is not uncommon, that the most promising players are picked up by the major clubs and coached from an early age." https://sportsaspire.com/soccer-in-spain

Title: Richness - Opportunity in block chain space

Content:
From my understanding of life, becoming a billionaire or becoming rich is not the goal of life. And I used to call myself ambitious, but I learnt to dislike the word "Ambition" now. Ambition is a self-centered outlook that only works within your context and is more often disconnected. I rather love the word "Vision" now and want to be a part in the bigger process for creativity. Anyway, if you become rich, good for you. But I will value you for the things that matter for me or the society around, not for the things that you own personally. Being happy and feeling the passion for living and doing good things for you and people around you give you the purpose for living further and create. If you have realized the complexity of life and managed to remain happy, then probably you would like everyone to be happy around you with your rich mind or create jobs to employ people so that they can have better life. An inclusive mind and an inclusive society and an inclusive economy are what we should envision. However, I am posting this to make you realize that there are people who seize the opportunity, who can see through and work hard to become what they become. And they create and contribute even more sometimes. And it should be inspiring for us to explore and may be find our own path to richness of both kinds. There will always be things in the hand of luck, but what you can change or take is what you should focus on. And that's where the dimension of time comes into place. All we are losing is time every moment if we haven't made the best use of it. I feel like the block chain, Bitcoin space is full of opportunities for many, for researchers, academicians, statisticians, economists, engineers, programmers, data scientists like me, businessman or woman, large companies, governments, individuals. For change, you need disruption sometimes. To be enthusiastic, you need something that excites. So, cheering for all of your endeavors and everyone to utilize your opportunities in this space to feel proud of. Hope you will create opportunities for others through your service of whatever kind. But if you don't want to read a story of a crypto billionaire, but rather prefer to read about philosophy from a Yogi about creativity, vision or ambition. Read this: http://isha.sadhguru.org/blog/lifestyle/success/ambition-to-vision-more-to-all/ Have a great day, guys. https://amp-timeinc-net.cdn.ampproject.org/c/amp.timeinc.net/time/money/5198682/cryptocurrency-billionaires

What the big three sharks are saying. Somewhat dumb, somewhat great! Investor's hat is definitely crucial, but not always the best. And I always love the entrepreneur's hat. Who wouldn't like to have the both hats with all different colors and taste!! ;) https://youtu.be/TE1m2oahdU8 Shark tank is a great platform that filters entrepreneurs, startup, growing business. If you haven't known or watched shark tanks, you should definitely start. We human being are idea generators, everybody has ideas. Everytime you walk on the street or malls, you come up with ideas, it's just the few who take the leap to materialize. Shark tank will give you some glimpse of what I just said, when you will see how innocuous, small ideas can go big if it's under the right arm. Shark tank is one of the things that I like in both the fat, obese, dumb, racist in one hand and multicultural, smart, free, open, entrepreneurial North America on the other. LoL.;) If you get the joke. Haha. You become what you choose to.. Here's a great playlist for popular shark tank videos and roastings.

Well, a lot of us are fan of Khaleesi on Game of Thrones(GOT) and her fire-exhaling Dragons. It's then a natural question :) whether there existed creatures who could breathe or exhale fire. And science answers with a big "No" as there's no evidence. Apparently the Bible thumpers and the wishful imaginative thinking of us! It feels exciting to see those dragons on GOT though!! I am reading "The Ancestor's Tale" by RD and within few hours, I have learnt so much about mesmerizing animals with their own features on the planet which survived, diverged, got trapped etc. The jurassic park movie did a great job on Jurassic period, but there's so much more story in our ancestry and concestry. I wish there were GOT like fictions based on the animals/creatures that exist, as most of us are not fans of animal planet like channels.

Sometimes I forget what I myself wrote.. And then when I read and realize again, I feel to slap myself for not remembering everything I told to myself. And I wake up. "You don't find purpose, because there is no purpose pre-ordained. You make your own purpose of your life. There is no ultimate purpose. I know, that feels like a huge slap on the face like most truths. Every morning you wake up, you will have to reinvigorate your purpose. You are free to change your purpose, you are free to not have any purpose. You are responsible for every thing your brain produces even though you have no control over most of them. You are mostly responsible for every action you make with your conscious, unconscious or subconscious mind. Yes.. Life is scary. But it's better not to live delusionally but to face it. You were not alive on this mother earth for billions of years.. you won't be alive on this universe filled with joy and distress for more than trillions of years.. So, the less than 100 years you got, don't waste.. enjoy and live.. if you can have a purpose and propagate that in human culture, that's a plus.. Even though there's only one earth physically, but actually the number of perceived earth and the number of human brains are equal. If the purpose you think about is dictated by someone else, you are doomed. So.. You need to open your heart and reach other people who have purpose in their lives to learn and live and probably get a reference. And then.. you probably make your very own purpose. And be happy that you are alive. Pinch yourself to verify. You can either feel scared how little and insignificant you are amidst of the billions of exploding stars or you can think that you yourself are a stardust meaning you are part of everything. Every urge you have to eat, sleep, fuck are evolutionarily designed into you. Learn how to deal with it with good examples from others who lived meaningfully.. But eventually you will have to live on your own. Miserably if you choose wrong, meaningfully if you can make a purpose of your own and strive to be happy and productive. Existentialism at its core, but not ridiculing nihilists too. Hail to Sartre and Nietzsche. And blue is the warmest color." My other quora posts: https://www.quora.com/profile/Zehady-Abdullah-Khan

So.. the pursuit of happiness. Some statistics just make me sad. People in America are suiciding more than ever. And I probably should not try to find the statistics in Japan. And in most developing and underdeveloped countries, these statistics are not even collected properly to see. Every day when a person wakes up, doesn't he or she should want to make the today a little better than days before? But unfortunately, it seems we live in the vicious circle of disappointment, distrust, heartbreak, depression and potentially the desire to end ourselves. We are so solely focussed on our own life and all the pleasures but still we can't see. The human mind is one of the biggest invention of nature. The immense power it possesses, the creativity and the imaginative nature! But still it seems like we live in a hell within our selves. And for some, it's so terrible that the only way they can think of is to shut them down forever.

Just posting my Quora answer.. Intelligent, peaceful, skillful immigrants are needed not only in US but also in every other country. Because cultural assimilation is a dire need of our time. If you look at most of the problems we have in our society, they are born out of close mindedness of the people. Why racism is a problem, coz some people just deny or at least used to deny human rights to people who have darker skin. Why an immigrant can find job, but an American can not? You are born in America, but you haven't explored much or expanded your horizons much to find a job. An immigrant is crossing the ocean or a desert and taking the risk and learning his way to live in a society by learning a different language. That is what a great great great grandparents of a jobless American might have done that the great great great grand son or daughter now doesn't understand. I have met Americans in Japan when I lived there. When they couldn't find job in America, they went to Japan and started teaching English to Japanese kids, married Japanese women and are now living there happily. My American friend now lives in Shikoku, Japan and I'm now living within 3 hours of his American home in Michigan. This is how the world should look like. We assimilate, we know, we challenge, we meet people, we make friends, we figure out what we like or dislike, we grow our potential and we live. Nobody is entitled to have anything for granted. Reading a little bit of history will give more persepective. Seeing some statistics on social well being, education, contribution to society by race, by country will open your mind. British have run the world for hundred years, where are they now? America in the sixties have had the highest and happiest middle class, what happened now? World, society will forever change and we should be resilient enough to adapt with the change. Instead of blaming immigrants taking away jobs, an American should rather unite with other Americans of all color and race and legal peaceful immigrants to see how politics and legislations in this country can be made so that people have more rights, more jobs and happy lives, how it's possible to inspire people or communities rather than infuriating them. Yes, illegal immigration is a problem, but what is to do now to ensure the overall well being of everyone should be the focus or priority. Sometimes sentimental talks and arguments just divide us too much; rather constructive criticism and thoughts should unite us to find real solution to the real problem towards welfare. Putting people in suffering and building walls will never bring wealth and prosperity. So, we should all be critical thinker, empathetic and creative to create a great society. Let's move our lazy ass, educate ourselves, do what needs to be done in our own space within our reach without complaining too much! https://www.quora.com/Why-are-immigrants-needed-in-the-U-S-when-many-Americans-dont-have-jobs/answer/Zehady-Abdullah-Khan?share=f8d596b1&srid=X0U1

Title: How do Paleoclimatologists investigate about ancient Earth? What are different Climate Proxies and what are their significance?
Published Date: Wed, 11 Apr 2018 23:46:36 +0000
Categories & Tags: Analysis, CoderMind, Earth Science, Home, science, earth climate science proxy
Content:
To know and understand about ancient climate, different climate proxies are generally used. We can measure the concentration of greenhouse gases by using entrapped air in the Greenland and Antarctic glaciers which give us samples of the atmosphere back to about 420 Kyr. The glaciers in North America and on mountains in tropical Andes can be estimated from scour marks, moraines and erratic boulders.Forams are microscopic organisms whose life cycles depend on local temperature and whose fossils preserve samples of ancient material. Some planktic forams (short for foraminifera) represent a "proxy" for sea surface temperature as they indirectly inform us about the temperature. One of the most remarkable proxies is the ratio of oxygen isotopes in benthic(bottom dwelling) forams in ancient sediment, which reflect the total amount of ice that existed on the Earth at the time the sea beds were formed. A scientist needs to be careful in their analysis as most proxies are dependent on more than one aspect of climate. Now I will discuss the primary proxies which have been used to investigate paleoclimate. Many of the samples come from seafloor cores, cores from Greenland or Anatarctic ice. The cores are named V22-174, RC13-110, DSXP-806 etc. In the geologic community, various of these prefixes are used some of which are enlisted below: V: Vema, a converted yacht operated by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia university. RC: Research vessel Robert Conrad. DSDP: Deep Sea Drilling Project operated from 1968 to 1983 by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego. ODP: Ocean Drilling Program as an international collaboration.\newline GRIP: European based GReenland Ice-core Project. GISP2: US-based Greenland Ice Sheet Project #2. Vostok: Russian station on the East Antarctic ice plateau. MD: The research vessel Marion Dufresne, operated by the French. 1. Oxygen Isotopes The pattern of oxygen isotopes is remarkably similar in sea floor records around the world and this universality feature is very attractive for a climate proxy. The ratio of oxygen istopes found in ice, trapped air, benthic/planktic forams is widely used as a climate proxy. Oxygen consists of three stable istopes: $latex 99.759$% is $latex ^{16}O$, $latex 0.037$% is $latex ^{17}O$, and $latex 0.204$% is $latex ^{18}O$. The variation in the fraction of $latex ^{18}O$latex can be measured with high accuracy. The fractional change, shown by the following equation, basically means that how much difference of the ratio of $latex \frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O}$latex exists in perts per thousand in the sample compared to the reference. $latex \delta^{18}O = \left(\frac{\left(\frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O}\right)_{Sample}}{\left(\frac{^{18}O}{^{16}O}\right)_{Reference}} - 1\right) \times 1000$ Oxygen isotope separation occurs because of the isotopic differences in vapour pressure and chemical reaction rates, which depends on temperature. Some of the most important geophysical processes that lead to changes in $latex \delta^{18}O$ are: Evaporated water is ligher than the remaining liquid. Water containing $latex ^{16}O$ has higher vapor pressure than water containing $latex ^{18}O$, so it evaporates quickly. Precipitated water molecules are heavier than those in the residual vapor. $latex H_2^{18}O$ condenses more readily than $latex H_2^{16}O$, so as water vapour is carried across to Greenland or to central Anatarctica, the residual becomes lighter. Oceanic $latex \delta^{18}O$ in non-uniformly distributed. It means that the changes in the pattern of winds that carry vapor and change the source will also change $latex \delta^{18}O$. At present, the difference in surface water is $latex 1.5$% from pole to equator. Biological activity enriches the heavy isotope. The $latex \delta^{18}O$ in the calcium carbonate of shells is $latex 40$% greater, on average, than in the water in which the organism lives. The net result of these effects is that glacial ice is light, with $latex \delta^{18}O$ typically lower than seawater. So, in glacial ice containing more $latex ^{16}O$, $latex \delta^{18}O$ is negative, where as in surface water containing more $latex ^{18}O$, $latex \delta^{18}O$ is positive. However, when large volumes of ice are stored in ace-gage glaciers, then there can be considearable depletion of the light isotopes in the oceans. In 1964, Dansgaard and colleageus showed that measurements of isotopic enrichment in ocean water as a function of latitude yield the following approximate relationship between temperature $latex T$ and $latex \delta^{18}O$: $latex \delta^{18}O \equiv 0.7 T - 13.6$ However, there can be other factors in the change of $latex \delta^{18}O$. Therefore, if we go back to earlier when the temperature was lower, $latex \delta^{18}O$ might not be lower which contradicts the above equation. When several measurements are made at the same latitude, the effect is argued to depend on the amount of precipitation and not on temperature. Moreover, depending on the source, we will have to consider other issues. In planktic fossils, we might expect $latex \delta^{18}O$ to reflect surface conditions, and therefore be sensitive to temperature and salinity conditions. In benthic forams, $latex \delta^{18}O$ must be more sensitive to global ice, since there is little temperature variation on the sea floor. In other samples (e.g. ice, trapper air or calcite), $latex \delta^{18}O$ may represent the temperature, not ice volutme. Several attempts have been made to extract the underlying $latex \delta^{18}O$ signal that is common in the records. SPECMAP stack (Imbrie et al., 1984) was a combination of five $\delta^{18}O$ records from five cores: V30-40, RC11-120, V280238 and DSDP502b. 2. Deuterium - Temperature Proxy Hydrogen generally contains only one proton in its nucleus and is lighter with atomic weight 1. Deuterim ($latex D$ or $latex ^2H$), on the other hand, is one of the heavy isotopes of hydrogen which contains one proton and one neutron in its nucleus and thus the atomic weight is 2. Bonds formed with deuterium tend to be much more stable than those with light hydrogen. The deuterated water is more sensitive to temperature than that of $latex ^{18}O$. We can clearly see it in the "fractionation factor" which describes the equilibrium between liquid and vapour. The fractionation factor is defined to be the ratio of D/H in a liquid to the ratio of D/H in a vapor that is in equilibrium with that liquid. The fractionation factor for HDO is approximately 1.08 and it varies more rapidly with temperature compared to $latex ^{18}O$. Therefore, the condensation of the deuterised form of heavy water ($latex HDO$) is significantly more sensitive to temperature variation than is the $latex ^{18}O$ form ($latex H_2^{18}O$). Therefore, deuterim is considered as a temperature proxy. A temperature scale was devised fro the Vostok ice core by assuming the equation: $latex \Delta T = \frac{\Delta \delta D_{ICE} - \Delta \delta^{18}O_{SW}}{9}$ where, the $\delta^{18}O_{SW}$ refers to the sea floor isotope record. 3. Carbon-13 Carbon on the earth has two stable istopes, $latex ^{12}C$ with an bundance of $latex 98.9$% and $latex ^{13}C$ with an abundance of $latex 1.1$%. The ratio of these two isotopes is described by the quantity $latex \delta^{13}C$ and defined by the equation below. The reference value is often taken to be a sample known as the "Peedee belemnite" (PDB); its $latex \delta^{13}C$ value is very close to that of mean sea water. $latex \delta^{13}C = \left(\frac{\left(\frac{^{13}C}{^{12}C}\right)_{Sample}}{\left(\frac{^{13}C}{^{12}C}\right)_{Reference}} - 1\right) \times 1000$ The lighter isotope, $latex ^{12}C$, is easily absorbed into the organic tissue of plants, leading to negative values for $latex ^{13}C = -20$% to $latex -25$%. In regions in which photosynthesis is active, this removes typically $latex 10-20$% of the dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater, leading to $latex ^{13}C$ enrichment in surrounding water. Because different regions of the world have different activity, there is geographic variation. Warm surface water has the highest $latex \delta^{13}C$, where as deep Pacific water has the lowest $latex \delta^{13}C$. Thus $latex \delta^{13}C$ can be used as a tracer for oceanic currents. In contrast, there is only small separation of carbon istotopes that takes place in the formation of caclcium carbonate shells. Thus the measurement of $latex \delta^{13}C$ reflects the composition of the ocean water at the time and location in which the shell grew. $latex ^{13}C$ is extremely important isotope for paleoclimate studies, because it responds to the presence of life. $latex \delta^{13}C$ can record climate change. During glacial periods, biological activity was reduced by advancing glaciers and colder temperature, and light carbon was released into the atmosphere and eventually mixed into the oceans. $latex \delta^{13}C$ from benthic (bottom dwelling) forams is typically $latex 0.35$% lower during glacials than during interglacials. In contrast, planktic forms don't show such changes. 4. Vostok The ice core from the Vostok site in Antarctica (Petit et al., 1999) located at $latex 78^oS$ and $latex 107^oE$, covers the longest period of time of any ice record. It reached a depth of 3623 metres. A untuned but unbiased timescale was derived based on ice accumulation and glacial flow models. Many proxies of climate interest were measured in the Vostok core, including atmospheric methane, atmospheric oxygen, deuterium in the ice, dust content and sea salt. Atmospheric methane is produced by the biological activity of anaerobic bacteria and it's existence in paleoclimate data is presumed to reflect the area of the earth covered by swamps and wetlands. The observed dust (strong 100 Kyr cycle) in the Vostok dust record is beleived to reflect reduction in vegetation during those periods and accompanying increase in wind-blown erosion. Then, the sodium concentration reflects the presence of sea spray aerosols blowing over the Vostok region. 5. Atmospheric $latex \delta^{18}O$ and Dole Effect The atmospheric oxygen has a $latex \delta^{18}O$ of $latex +23.5$% compared to that of mean ocean sea water due to the removal of lighter isotope $latex ^{16}O$ from the atmosphere by biological activity. The difference is called the "Dole Effect" and it is assumed to be time-independent. 6. $latex \delta^{18}O$ / $CO_2$ Mystery The difference between ocean and atmospheric $\delta^{18}O$ is due to the biological activity. However, carbon dioxide, even though driven by biological processes, doesn't show similar spectra. The strong peaks in the oxygen signal forced by precession parameter is absent in the carbon dioxide record which is mysterious and still under investigation. 7. Other Sea Floor Records 7.1 Terrigenous component The terrigenous component of sea floor sediment is the fraction which has possibly come from land, in the form of wind-blown dust. The most significant frequencies which have been found in the spectrum of detuned terrigenous component Site 721 are marked with the periods: 41, 24, 22 and 19 Kyr. These periods indicate that the signals were dominated by solar insolation. 7.2 Foram size: the coarse, or "sand", component In the sea floor core, the main component of the sand is frequently large forams. Therefore, the coarse component reflects an interesting change in the ecology of the oceans. A clear eccentricity signal was detected in a core that already showed a clear absence of eccentricity in the $latex \delta^{18}O$ component. 7.3 Lysocline: carbonate isopleths Pressure varies in different depths of the ocean and which consequently influences the solubility of the calcium carbonate. At a certain depth, the shells of fossil plankton begin to dissolve, and this boundary is called lysocline. It can be quantified by the percentage of calcium carbonate in the sediment, as a function of depth. One can plot the depth at which the 60% lysocline is found, as a function of age and this depends on the depth of the oceans at that age. The signal apeears to be dominated by a 100 Kyr cycle, as would be expected if the primary driving force were the depth of the ocean, determined by the amount of ice accumulated on land.

My friend on Facebook posted.. Those who keep saying “Money Can’t Buy Everything” don’t have enough money. And I argued: "It's very easy to disprove. Can a billionaire buy you with money? Yes or No? Can he buy to be the most empathetic person, can he buy to be the best scientist? I can go on and on what he can not buy. But it's true that he can buy lots of things that most people can't. But even if, what is it that most people want.. big house, big salary, luxary cars, jewelery, ability to travel, power and influence. I can give you hundreds of examples of enthusiastic people who are not rich, who are doing these way better than Donald Trump or some other boring billionaires. Just watch Instagram and YouTube mindfully, how beautifully people can live with less. Money can't buy creativity, peace in mind; it can just help towards that path. It's just a vehicle for comfort and survival but it itself is not the comfort and happiness. But look.. this kind of mentality that money is everything.. imprison the free mind and make your mind and then life a living hell. Do u really not think you can just leave every fucking luxary and go to a jungle and live peacefully eating fruits? I am telling you I can totally see myself doing that if that's whats gonna give me happiness and peace. I'm not a prisoner of the society and the world where money is required. LoL. Money is just a peace of paper. It's the idea and perception of living that's important. Peace!! Haha. ;)" What do you think and say? I would like to hear.

Quantiles What are quantiles in statistics? If the data is sorted from small to big, Quantiles are the points which divide the data/samples into equal sized, adjacent subgroups. Every data sample has maximum value, minimum value, median value(the middle value after you sort the data). The middle value in the sorted data is the 50% quantile because half of the data are below that point and half above that point. A 25% quantile is the cut point in the data where 1/4 -th of the data is below the point. IQR is inter-quartile range which contains half of the data which contains the median and are higher than the 25% low-value data point but less than the 25% high-value data point. Box Plot A box-plot can be a good representation to show the quantiles. Box plot can take different shapes depending on the data. Here is an example: (image source: www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/box2.html) Example of Discrete/Continous Probability Distribution In the figure below, you can see different frequency distribution. The blue data samples have most of it's data near (0,1) interval, it's left skewed. Check how the blue box is shifted to the left. The green data samples are normally distributed, meaning most of the data points are centered around zero. It also looks balanced. We find normal distribution in nature and in biological and social phenomena very often. The orange one shows almost a uniform distribution, where the data is spreaded across the range. And lastly a right skewed data. These are all discrete data points with discrete probability distribution. There are also very well known continuous probability distribution with continuous probability density function(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions#Continuous_distributions). (Image source: https://www.otexts.org/node/620) Below we can see the quantiles for the normal distribution- the cut points which divide the continuous range of points in equal probability area. The area over an interval (in x axis) under a continuous probability density function (like the normal distribution function below) represents the probability of the data falling into that range. In this case, the IQR is the blue box; data point in that interval has 50% probability of occurrence. Q-Q plot We can use Q-Q plot to graphically compare two probability distributions. Q-Q plot stands for Quantile vs. Quantile plot. In Q-Q plotting, we basically compute the probabilities assuming a certain distribution (e.g. normal, gamma or poisson distribution) from the data and then compare it with theoritical quantiles. The steps used in Q-Q plotting is: Sort the data points from small to large For n data points, find n equally spaced points which serve as the probability using $latex \frac{k}{n+1} $ where $latex k=1, 2, ..., n$ Look at the data points, possibly plot it and assume the underlying probability distributions. Using the probabilities from the step 2, now you can calculate quantiles. Like in R language, you can use the quantile functions like qnorm or qgamma or qunif from the stats package. Now plot by putting the calculated quantiles in step 3 in x axis and putting the sorted data points in the y-axis. If the data points stay close to the $latex y=x$ line, that means your assumption of the probability distribution was correct. Below you can see one example, where the normal distribution is assumed for the ozone data. T Now you can see the gamma distribution fits better to the ozone data than the normal distribution. This is how you can check different probability distribution for your data using simple Q-Q plot. There is a fantastic Q-Q plot tutorial from which I collected the above image.

Fourier Transform It was a significant discovery in mathematics that any function can be expanded as a sum of harmonic functions (sines and cosines) and the resulting expression is known as Fourier series. A harmonic of repeating signals such as sunusoidal wave is a wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of the frequency of the original wave, known as the fundamental frequency. The original wave is called the first harmonic, the following harmonics are known as higher harmonics. Any function can also be expanded in terms of polynomials and the resulting expression is known as Taylor series. If the underlying forces are harmonic and there possibly exists some periodicity, then the use of harmonic series is more useful than using polynomials as it produces simpler equations. It is possible to discover a few dominating terms from such series expansion which may help identify the known natural forces with the same period. Let the symbol $latex h(t)$ represent a continuous function of time. The Fourier transform is a function of frequency $latex f$. $latex H_T(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(t) e^{2 \pi i f t} dt$ $latex e^{2 \pi i f t} = cos(2\pi f t) + i sin(2\pi f t)$ The amplitude and the phases of the sine waves can be found from this result. Given data $latex h(t)$, we can find the Fourier transform $latex H(f)$ using Inverse Fourier transform. $latex h(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} H_T(f) e^{-2 \pi i f t} dt$ The spectral power $latex P$ is defined as the square of the Fourier amplitude: $latex P_T(f) = |H_T(f)|^2$ However, real data does not span infinite time and most likely be sampled only at a few discrete points over time. Suppose that, we received values of $latex h(t)$ at times $latex t_j$, then an estimate of the Fourier transform is made by using summation. The inverse transform is also shown using the summation. $latex h_j \equiv h(t_j)$ $latex H(f) \equiv \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} h_j e^{2 \pi i f t_j}$ The data are desired to be sampled from equally spaced time as nice statistical properties are available in such regular case. If the interval between equally spaced data points is $latex \Delta t$, then the highest frequency that will appear in the fourier transform is given by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The theorem states "If a function $latex f(t)$ contains no frequencies higher than $latex f$ Hz, then it is completely determined by giving its ordinates at a series of points spaced $latex \frac{1}{2f}$ seconds apart". Therefore, the Nyquist frequency (highest frequency) is given by the following equation. $latex f_N = \frac{1}{2\Delta t}$ The lowest frequency is the one that gives one full cycle in the time interval $latex T$. The other frequencies to evaluate is the multiples ($latex f_k$) of the low frequency $latex f_L$. And, also we can derive the symmetric pair of equations. Moreover, if $latex h(t)$ is band-limited (no frequencies below $latex f_L$ or above $latex f_N$), then there is a relationship between the continuous function $latex h(t)$ and the discrete values $latex H_k$. $latex f_L = \frac{1}{T}$ $latex f_k = kf_L$ $latex H_k \equiv \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} h_j e^{2 \pi i jkf_L t_j}$ $latex h_j = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} H_k e^{2 \pi i jkf_L t_j}$ $latex h(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} H_k e^{2 \pi i kf_L t}$ (when band limited) Periodogram Fourier transform give us the complex numbers and the square of the absolute value of these numbers represent the periodogram. This is the first form of numerical spectral analysis and is used to estimate spectral power. Even though the data points collected are at evenly spaced specific discrete time, it is possible to evaluate periodogram at any frequencies. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) We can calculate the Fourier transform very efficiently by using FFT. It requires data at equally-spaced time points, and is most efficient when the number of points is an exact power of two. Interpolation is often used to produce the evenly-spaced data which may introduce additional bias and systematic eror. For real data consisting of $latex N$ data points $latex y_j$, each taken at time $latex t_j$, the power spectrum outputs a set of $latex N+1$ data points. The first and the last data points are the same, and they represent the power at frequency zero. The second through to the $latex N/2 + 1$ data points represent the power at evenly-spaced frequencies up to the Nyquist frequency. The spectral power for a given frequency is distributed over several frequency bins, therefore an optimum determination of the power requires combining these information and proper investigation of leakage. FFT, generally, calculates the amplitude for a set of frequencies. N/2 complex amplitudes are calculated at N/2 different frequencies. Because, these may not be the true frequencies present in the record, we subtract the mean from the data and then pad it with zeros to overcome this challenge. Aliasing The time series consists of measurements made at a discrete, equally spaced, set of times on some phenomenon that is actually evolving continuously, or at least on a much finer time scale. For example, samples of Greenland Ice represent the temperature every 100 years, but if the sampling is not precisely spaced by a year, we will sometimes measure winter ice, and other times measure summer ice. Even without the existence of long-term variation in the temperature, fluctuations (jumping up and down) in the data can be noticed. So, there can be frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency associated with the sampling interval. Thus a peak in the true spectrum at a frequncy beyond the Nyquist frequency may be strong enough to be seen(aliased) in the spectrum which may give the impression that a frequency is significant when it is not. Or, a peak may partly obscure another frequency of interest. This phenomenon is known as aliasing. Tapering Fourier transform is defined for a function on a finite interval and the function needs to be periodic. But with the real data set, this requirment is not met as the data end suddenly at t=0 and t=T and can have discontinuities. This discontinuity introduces distortions (known as Gibbs phenomenon) in fourier transform and generates false high frequency in the spectrum. Tapering (using data window) is used to reduce these artificial presence. The data $latex y=f(t)$ is multiplied by a taper function $latex g(t)$ which is a simple, slowly varying function, often going towards zero near the edges. Some of the popular tapers are: 1. Sine taper $latex g(t) = sin(\pi t/T)$ 2. Hanning (offset cosine) taper $latex g(t) = \frac{1}{2}(1-cos(2\pi t/T))$ 3. Hamming taper $latex g(t) = 0.54 - 0.46cos(2 \pi t/T) $ 4. Parzen or Bartlett (triangle) window $latex g(t) = 1 - (t - T/2)/(T/2)$ 5. Welch (parabolic) window $latex g(t) = 1 - (t - T/2)^2/(T/2)^2$ 6. Daniell (untapered or rectangular) window $latex g(t) = 1$ The frequency resolution in the spectrum of the tapered data is degraded. If the primary interest is the resolution of peaks, then the untapered periodogram is superior. However, tapering significantly reduces the sidelobes and also the bias applied to other nearby peaks by the sidelobes of a strong peak. Because, the taper functions are broad and slowly varying and their fourier transform FT(g) are narrow. The effect of tapering the data is to convolve the fourier transform of the data with the narrow fourier transform of the taper function which amounts to smoothing the spectral values. $latex FT(fg) = FT(f) * FT(g)$ p style="text-align:justify;"> // Sine taper t <- seq(0,1, by=0.01) T <- 1 g <- sin(pi * t * T) plot(t, g, t='l', col=1, ylab='g(t)') // Hanning (offset cosine) taper g2 <- 1/2 * (1-cos(2*pi*t/T)) lines(t, g2, t='l', col=2) // Hamming g3 <- 0.54 - 0.46 * cos(2*pi*t/T) lines(t, g3, t='l', col=3) // Parzen or Bartlett (triangle) window g4 0.5, 1 - (t-T/2)/(T/2), 2*t) lines(t, g4, t='l', col=4) // Welch (parabolic) window g5 <- 1 - (t-T/2)^2/(T/2)^2 lines(t, g5, t='l', col=5) // Daniell window g6 <- rep(0.5, length(t)) g6 <- ifelse(t <= 0.2, 0, g6) g6 = 0.8, 0, g6) lines(t, g6, t='l', col=6) legnd = c('Sine', 'Hanning', 'Hamming', 'Bartlett', 'Welch', 'Daniell(20%)') legend('topleft', legend=legnd ,col=1:6, lty=1, cex=0.75) Multitaper Analysis We apply taper or data window to reduce the side lobes of the spectral lines. Basically we want to minimize the leakage of power from the strong peaks to other frequencies. In multitaper method, several different tapers are applied to the data and the resulting powers then averaged. Each data taper is multiplied element-wise by the signal to provide a windowed trial from which one estimates the power at each component frequency. As each taper is pairwise orthogonal to all other tapers, the windowed signals provide statistically independent estimates of the underlying spectrum. The final spectrum is obtained by averaging over all the tapered spectra. D. Thomson chose the Slepian or discrete prolate spheroidal sequences as tapers since these vectors are mutually orthogonal and possess desirable spectral concentration properties. Multitaper method can suppress sidelobes but have higher resolution. If we use few tapers, the resolution won't be degraded, but then sidelobe reduction won't happen much. So, there is a trade-off which is often misunderstood. Blackman-Tuckey Method Blackman and Tuckey prescribed some techniques to analyze a continuous spectrum that was biased by the presence of sidelobes of strong peaks in the ordinary periodogram. Blackman-Tuckey(BT) method was developed before 1958, prior to the FFT(Fast Fourier Transform) method. A discrete fourier transform of N points would require the calculation of $latex N^2$ sines and cosines. With the slower computer in the pre-FFT days, the calculation of fourier transform was thus expensive. BT method has reduced the time by reducing the size of the dataset by a factor of the lag in the autocorrelation calculation. BT method is based on a fundamental theorem of Fourier transform that the Fourier transform of a correlation is equal to the product of the Fourier transforms. The correlation of two functions $latex g(t)$ and $latex h(t)$ is given by the first equation below. $latex C(\tau)=g\otimes h= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(t) h(t+\tau) d\tau$ $latex FT(g\otimes h) = FT(g) FT(h)$ When g = h, it is called Wiener-Khintchine theorem. Here, P is the spectral power. $latex FT(g\otimes g) = |FT(g)|^2 = P$ The algorithm in BT method calculates partial autocorrelation function, defined by $latex A_{BT}(\tau) = \int_{0}^{N/l} f(t+\tau)f(t) dt$ Here, N is the length of the data set but we integrate only upto $latex N/l$. $l$ is associated with the lag. When $latex l=3$ (recommended by Blackman and Tuckey) is used, we say that "a lag of 1/3" is used. Now the fourier transform of partial autocorrelation function $latex A_{BT}$ gives us the spectral power. Moreover, the symmetric property of the partial autocorrelation function $latex (A(-\tau) = A(\tau))$ saves half of the computation time. $latex FT(A_{BT}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{2\pi i ft } A_{BT}(\tau) d \tau = P_{BT}(f)$ $latex P_{BT}(f) = 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} cos(2\pi f) A_{BT}(\tau)$ If $latex l=1$, then it is basically the full autocorrelation function $latex A(\tau)$ and gives the same answer as the ordinary periodogram. $latex P(f) = 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} cos(2\pi f) A(\tau) = FT(A)$ Because we are using partial correlation function instead of the full correlation, the spectral power function gets smoother. Therefore, we lose resolution in the BT method. However, it averages the sidelobes into the main peak, and thereby gives a better estimate of the true power. The smoothing in BT method is different from the smoothing when we use a taper. With a taper, the fourier transform is smoothed, where as with Blackman-Tukey, it is the spectral power which gets smoothed. A spectral amplitude that is rapidly varying will be averaged to zero with a taper. But in BT method, a rapidly varying amplitude does not necessarily average to zero, since the process of squaring can make the function positive over the region of smoothing. The tapering does not average the sidelobes into the main peak. Because, shift in the time scale behaves like phase modulation. The sidelobes, when tapering is applied, will not have the same phase, and if averaged in amplitude, they can reduce the strength of the peaks. A major challenge in the BT method is that we will have to estimate the proper lag to use before doing all the calculations. Blackman and Tukey recommended starting with the value 1/3 for the lag. Lomb-Scargle Periodogram The classic periodogram requires evenly spaced data, but we frequently encounter with unevenly spaced data in paleoclimatic research. Lomb and Scargle showed that if the cosine and sine coefficients are normalized separately, then the classic periodogram can be used with unevenly spaced data. If we have a data set $latex (t_k, y_k)$, we first calculate the mean and variance: $latex \bar{y} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N}y_k$ $latex \sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{k=1}^{N}[y_k - \bar{y}]^2$ For every frequency f, a time constant $latex \tau$ is defined by $latex \tau = \frac{ \sum_{k=1}^{N}sin(4\pi f t_k)}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}cos(4\pi f t_k)}$ Then the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the spectral power $latex P(f)$ at frequency f is given by $P(f) = \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\frac{ \sum_{k=1}^{N}(y_k - \bar{y} ) [cos(2\pi f (t_k-\tau))]^2}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}cos^2(2\pi f (t_k-\tau))} + \frac{ \sum_{k=1}^{N}(y_k - \bar{y} ) [sin(2\pi f (t_k-\tau))]^2}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}cos^2(2\pi f (t_k-\tau))}$ With evenly spaced data, two signals of different frequencies can have identical values which is known as Aliasing. That is why the classic periodogram is usually shown with the frequency range from 0 to 0.5, as the rest is a mirrored version. But with Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the aliasing effect can be significantly reduced. Maximum Likelihood Analysis In maximum likelihood method, we adjust the parameter of the model and ultimately find the parameters with which our model have the maximum probability/likelihood of generating the data. To estimate the spectral power, we first select a false alarm probability and calculate the normalized periodogram. We identify the maximum peak and test it against the false alarm probability. If the maximum peak meets the false alarm test, we determine the amplitude and phase of the sinusoid representing the peak. Then we subtract the sinusoidal curve from the data which also removes the annoying sidelobes associated with that peak. After peak removal, the variance in the total record is also reduced. Now, with the new subtracted data, we continue finding the other stronger peaks following the same procedure. We stop when a peak does not meet the false alarm test. We need to carefully choose the false alarm probability, as if it is too low, we can miss some significant peaks; it is too low, we can mislabel noise as peaks. Maximum Entropy Method It is assumed that the true power spectrum can be approximated by an equation which has a power series. This method finds the spectrum which is closest to white noise (has the maximum randomness or "entropy") while still having an autocorrelation function that agrees with the measured values - in the range for which there are measured values. It yields narrower spectral lines. This method is suitable for relatively smooth spectra. With noisy input functions, if very high order is chosen, there may occur spurious peaks. This method should be used in conjuction with other conservative methods, like periodograms, to choose the correct model order and to avoid getting false peaks. Cross Spectrum and Coherency If a climate proxy $latex a(t)$ is influenced or dominated by a driving force $latex b(t)$, we can use cross spectrum to see if their amplitudes are similar. Cross spectrum is given by the product of the fourier transform. $latex C(f) = A(f) B^*(f)$ where A is the Fourier transform of a and B is the complex conjugate of the fourier transform of b. If we want to know whether two signals are in phase with each other, regardless of amplitude, then we can take the cross spectrum, square it, and divide by the spectral powers of individual signals using the following equation for coherency. Coherency measures only the phase relationship and is not sensitive to amplitude which is a big drawback. $latex c(f) = \frac{|C(f)|^2}{P_a(f) P_b(f)}$ Coherency is valuable if two signals that are varying in time, stay in phase over a band of frequencies instead of a single frequency. Therefore, a band of adjacent frequancies are used in the averaging process to compute coherency: $latex coherency(f) = \gamma^2(f) = \frac{|<C(f)>|^2}{<P_a(f)> <P_b(f)>}$ Bispectra In bispectra, coherency relationship between several frequencies are used. A bispectrum shows a peak whenever (1) three frequencies $latex f_1$, $latex f_2$ and $latex f_3$ are present in the data such that $f_1 + f_2 = f_3$ and (2) the phase relationship between the three frequencies is coherent for at least a short averaging time for a band near these frequencies. If the nonlinear processes in driving force (e.g. eccentricity or inclination of the orbit of earth) has coherent frequency triplets, then the response (i.e. climate) is likely to contain same frequency triplet. For example, $latex \delta ^{18}O$ is driven by eccentricity, we should be able to find eccentricity triplet. Thus, by comparing the bispectrum plot of climate proxy with the bispectrum plot of the driving forces, we can verify the influences of driving forces. ## Monte Carlo Simulation of Background Monte carlo simulation is extremely useful to answer the questions like whether the data is properly tuned or not, whether the timescale is incorrect, whether some spectral power is being leaked to adjacent frequencies, whether the peak has real structure and also to understand the structures near the base of the peak (a shoulder) in a spectral analysis. Generally monte carlo simulation is run multiple times. For each simulation, a real signal(sinusoidal wave) is generated, then random background signal is added, then the spectral power is calculated to look for shoulders. In this way, the frequency of the shoulder occurence can be measured and the randomness can be realized. It is important to create background that behaves similarly to the background in real data. Dissimilar background will cause false conclusion. We also need to estimate the statistical significance of the peaks very carefully.

Title: The Ancestor's Tale
Published Date: Fri, 27 Apr 2018 21:37:52 +0000
Categories & Tags: Evolution, Home, science
Content:
Some brief ideas, that I had to answer from my reading professor Richard Dawkin's The Ancestor's Tale book. Some answers may be incomplete. (1)  Briefly, what is evolution? Ans:   The process by which different kind of living organisms have developed and diversified from their earlier forms during the history of the earth. Evolution is generally a gradual development towards something complex from something simple. Evolutionary history can be represented as branching from one species to other species. (2)  There is geologic time, which relies on the rock record; and "absolute" (or numerical or "linear") time, which relies on calibrated clocks. Which one was emphasized most in "The Ancestor's Tale" when discussing the events in the history of life, and Why? Ans:   “Absolute dating” (Putting absolute age on the fossils using Radioactive dating, Dendrochronology, Paleomagnetism, Molecular clock) is emphasized. Geologic dating requires vertical piecing together of rocks from different parts of the world and then determine ages like solving puzzles. The different rendezvous ages are determined by absolute age. (3)  The fossil record WAS used for the dating of major divergences of types of life, and the "beginning to extinction" range of a family. What are some general problems with relying entirely on this fossil record?  [Hint: Explain why "lowest known occurrence" of a new family type is usually an underestimate; and similarly "highest known occurrence".] What major types of abundant multi-cellular life would not leave a useful fossil record? ….. Ans: There are lots of gaps or incomplete records in the collective fossil records. Moreover, not every type of organism gets fossilized. Relying only on the fossil record can lead to false conclusion. For example, if we only found large, big-boned dinosaur fossils and no small-light boned vertebrate, can we conclude that only large animals lived there? We can not, because light boned vertebrates did not turn into fossils. .              .Most of the time only bones, shells and teeth get fossilized. The mazor types of abundant multi-cellular lives are Amphibians, Annelida, Mollusca which don’t leave any fossils as they are soft bodied and have delicate or no bones. We only learn of their existence with fossilized burrows, trackways or impressions left on the soft sediment. (4)  "Molecular clock" is NOW used for the dating of major divergences of types of life (including some of the Ancestor's Tale estimates, especially for soft-bodied life that doesn't leave shells in the sediment record). What is this concept of a "molecular clock",  and What are some important major requirements and assumptions for the "clock" part? What major types of abundant multi-cellular life would not leave a useful molecular-clock record? Ans:   This technique uses the count of discrepancies in molecular sequences between surviving species. The assumption is that the close cousins with recent common ancestor have fewer discrepancies. After the counting, scientists calibrate the arbintrary timescale of molecular clock and translate it into real years. They use known available fossil age for a few key branch points in the calibration process. (5)  Molluscs has twice as many species as vertebrates; but, even these are minor compared to another type of animal in diversity. What type of life has at least 3/4ths of all animal species, and probably dominated the land since the Silurian? What does that fact, plus related ones imply about the famous "family diversity through time" plots that are common in every textbook? Ans:  Arthropoda (insects, crustaceans, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes etc.) has at least 3/4ths fo all animal species. With their exosecleton and jointed leg and evolved segmented body, they dominated the land during Silurian (430 Ma). The diversity of families and species have started from Cambrian, then dropped a bit, then it steadily grow throughout Ordovician before the end Ordovician mass extinction, then again grew through Silurian and Devonian before the end Devonian extinction. Most Paleozoic fauna were at these periods and most of them were arthropods. After end Ordovician mass extinction, there was no sudden drop, rather stable before the P/T boundary. And then the modern fauna started to grow. (6)  Ediacaran (ca. 590 Ma) = "the biggest split of animals" into "Protostomia" ("mouth first") and "Deuterostome" ("mouth second"), based on the divergence in the way the embryo develops.  All animals fall in one or the other; and we are a "Deuterostome" branch.  It is easy from the Ancestor's Tale book to know what are in the Deuterostome group. But what are some main organisms in the Protostomia group? Ans: The main organisms in Protostima groups are Athropods, Mulluscs, flat worms, round worms, annelid worms, Nematode, Brachyozoa,  Bryozoa etc. (7)  earliest Silurian (ca. 440 Ma) = "a big one" split of "teleosts" from what would become amphibian-reptile-mammal (after a minor split-away of Coelacanths).  Other than the fact that these are "ray-finned fish" (all fish that are not shark-ray); what is the major life-style divergence? What does this imply about what may have been happening in the sea/land and the atmosphere environments?  [Note: think about what had to change to allow the split between the fish and the lungfish-tetrapod groups.] Ans: Sharks mainly live in sea water. The Ordovician period had cold sea. During Silurian, we got shallow warm water, high mountain lakes, acid stream, marshes, saline lake rivers. These teleosts (Ray finned fish) managed to live in these diverse habitats.  Teleosts lived in many levels of underwater, both salt and fresh water. Sharks always had to maintain the same level in the water, they didn’t have bone, rather only cartilage. But ray finned fish have bones. The descendant of rendezvous 19 was the lung fish. Humans, tetrapods, coalecant, lungfish all evolved from love-finned fish. (8)  late Carboniferous (ca. 310 Ma) = big split of amniotes (tetrapods producing membrane-eggs, even if some develop inside the body) into "sauropsids" (I hate that obscure name for the group) and "mammal-like reptiles" (a name that Richard Dawkins hates, so he suggests "mammal-like reptiles"). What are the apparent main distinctions (features that imply the separation) between the earliest "reptile-like mammals", such as "Dimetrodon" from the "sauropsids"?  [Note: consider what is grouped into the large "sauropsid" cluster.] Ans: Pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon are less mammal like the other branch where Therapsids evolved into Cynodont and then into modern mammals. Dimetrodons were more lizard like, sprawled their bellies, legs were spreaded in both sides. However, these reptile like mammals gradually raised their bellies progressively higher off the ground, legs more vertical and gradually evolved into modern mamals. Distance from the ground is probably the biggest difference. (9)  Cretaceous = Mammal divergence (ca. 100 Ma).  An important part of "mega-evolution" is isolation, then re-mixing.  We looked at "World's apart" evolution on isolated New Caledonia and New Zealand after they split from Gondwana.  However, Pangea supercontinent also split into South America, Laurasia (joined North America and Europe), Africa and Australia during the Cretaceous as the South Atlantic and the Antarctic oceans opened.  [Later, due to closure of Panama strait, the South America and Laurasia fauna mixed; but not Australian; and when Arabia closed with Eurasia, there were migrations into and out of Africa.]  These 4 large landmasses underwent different evolutionary paths, that are grouped as "Laurasia-theres", "Afro-theres","Xenarthrans", and "Marsupial/Monotreme" mammals.  Essentially, mammal evolution went into four paths during the last days of the dinosaurs, and the survivors of the end-Cretaceous catastrophe evolved to occupy the new niches independently in each regions. Briefly describe the range of types in each of the "Laurasia-theres", of ""Afro-theres", of "Xenathrans" and of "Marsupials"--  that together comprise these 4 main evolutionary groups of placental mammals. Ans:  Laurasia-theres include a) shrews, b) bats, c) camels, pigs, deer, sheep, hippos, whales, d) Horses, tapirs, rhinos, e) cats, dogs, bears, weasels, hynas, seals, walrus Aftrotheres include  elephants, manatees, dugongs, aardvark, golden moles, elephant shrews. Xenarthrans include sloths, armadillos. Marsupials include American and true opossum, shrew opossum, marsupial mole, Tasmanian devil, numbat, Manito del monte, Wombat, Kangaroos, possums, koala. (10)  Follow-up to the previous:  As a speculation, before Africa contacted Eurasia to mix with the "Laurasia-theres" -- What major differences would there have been with the African ecology?  [for example, What would have been the "top predator" and the most abundant herbivore?]  Why? Ans:  Africa didn’t have the carnivores, mainly herbivores. Carnivores came into aftrica from great northern continent of Laurasia. The trees were higher, elephants, giraffes were the herbivores which  had to reach high from the ground and therefore developed the large tall bodies. So, Africa was greener and habitable for the herbivores to diversify, where in Eurasia, carnivores depend on their preys. (11)  Another follow-up to the previous:  What does this "World's Apart" concept imply about using diversity indices for larger land organisms? Would you expect similar aspects for shallow-marine life, which dominates the fossil record?  Why? Ans:   World’s apart means isolation. In the case of Australia, giant island like Madagaskar, Galapagos, in isolation, from few small population of animals, a new class of diversified animals have come into existence. Even in shallow marine life, from fish or marine individual’s perspective, there are small islands of habitats where organisms grow and evolve. Possibly the lack of external predators help the diversity. (12)   Paleogene (ca. 50 Ma) – Monkey divergence.  There are "Old World Monkeys" (Africa-Eurasia), "New World Monkeys" (originally only South America) and "Lemurs" (mainly Madagascar).  When these three monkey-types diverged, there was no land connections, and monkeys don't swim. Which place seems to be the evolutionary "home" of the original monkeys; and How did those ancestors of monkey types then inhabit (and evolve to fill niches) in the other 2 regions separated by ocean seaways? Ans:   Africa seems to be the evolutionary home of the original monkeys. West Africa and south America were close. There were possibly chains of islands in between.. A small founding population of monkeys probably rafted across, perhaps on fragments of mangrove swamps which kept them alive and then they floated from Africa to south America. They were lucky to have the sea current towards the right direction. (13)  Briefly explain Why a "massively improbably event" is often nearly inevitable in geologic time. Ans:   Extremely improbable events are common in nature. Given enough opportunities, the probabilities of even very unlikely events can mount up to be almost certain. For example, the probability of one particular mutation during evolution may be very little, but there are billions of mutations happening continuously with the help of natural selection. So, therefore one single mutation is not very unlikely. David Hand proposed his improbability principle which is the combination of laws of truly large numbers, laws of inevitability and the laws of near enough. The law of near enough tells that we tend to identify similar but not identical event as identical event. It’s also a perception issue as we tend to pay attention to the improbable things that do happen and completely ignore the even large number of improbable things that does not happen. So, in nature, one in a million event happen all the time. When we are looking at geological time, where we mostly care the span of millions or billions of years, massively improbably event is thus easy to find. (14)  Neogene (ca. 15 myr) – Ape families "out of ?where?".  Dawkins explores the divergence between early hominids, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons; and the problems in explaining why some of them have fossils only in Eurasia, whereas others have fossils only in Africa (and neither has a complete fossil record in either location).  He then contrasts "out of Africa" with "out of Asia" and other debate ideas. Briefly summarize his preferred model (with which direction) for how small "founding populations" of apes and their relatives seem to have migrated between Africa and Asia, and then evolved and diverged. Ans:   Dawkins support the model of “Hopping to Asia from Africa and then back again to Africa from Asia”. It matches with the facts of drifting continents and fluctuations of sea levels. Steward Disotell created the family tree and if the tree is correct then according to this model A population of ape migrated from Africa to Asia around 20 Ma and became all the Asian ape including the living gibbons and orang utans A population of apes migrated back from Asia to Africa, became todays African ape (Gorillas, Chimanzees, Humans) including us. (15)  Quaternary (ca. 2 myr) – Hominids.  What is the main "defining difference" between "Australopithecus" and "Homo" genus of hominids? For the "Homo" species, what is the evidence that there were at least two "out of Africa" events? Ans:   The main difference is in the size of the brain. Compared to Austalopithecus, the brain started to expand beyond the normal size. It’s more of the brain size to body ratio than just the brain size. (16)  Late Pleistocene (ca. 40 kyr) -- Humans and cousins.  Could Neanderthals talk to each other? What was the "Great Leap Forward" for Homo sapiens sapiens? Ans:   Neanderthals are our closest cousin and they might have spoken with each other. They had social communities with complex lifestyle. They had clothing, jewelry and even bigger brain than ours. Jared Diamond coined the term “Great Leap Forward” which basically points to the flowering and flourishing of human mind which drove the evolutionary process. All the modern cultural, industrial changes have happened very rapidly. Before 40K, the things were very slow. The development of intellect in the brain was a great leap for mankind. Some points to the origin of language or written language, but Dawkins and Steven Pinker argues that the great leap may not be the language as the history of language seem older. It may be how we started using our brain critically or the ability to store or extrapolate or predict future. (17) In retrospect, what is required for surges in evolution of new types of life? How can we use databases of first/last fossil ranges to try to identify such surges, and their potential causes? Ans:   I guess, appropriate environment, genetic mutation, possible interbreeding.

Pessimism alert! Bad trip alert! However, I am optimistic. I've been thinking about life and miseries and roaming on YouTube and watching some documentaries. It seems to me where ever you are, what relative condition a life is ticking, every living being seems like struggling and feeling pain and suffocation and longing for getting out of the cage. Each seems to desire to live in a better condition, has a goal where each wants to reach, but then it can not, and then it is frustrated and unhappy. Each seems to feel confined in its living condition. And it's easy to die and the fear is real. It is like neverending unhappiness and struggle to live. All an individual animal and human think about are all that it don't have, can't have. Each has the survival instincts and the ability to feel joy and pain. Some are not naturally selected well. Some are trying to climb the ladder, some are falling, some are rising, some are winning, some are being extinguished. Some are not better equipped for existence, some are endowed with good social and physical environment, some are not. Some are lucky, but they feel unlucky. Some are unlucky, but are unaware of the way to bring a good fortune. For human, education and information acquisition seems necessary, but then even with education, with information you can feel trapped. It seems like in life feeling trapped is inevitable. It was a wild trip for me through internet. Normally you call or recognize that you were in the dark side of internet or youtube after such trip, as if you try to kick yourself into the good reality from a bad one, as if you feel the desire that bad things don't exist, at least not for you, you only want to watch the good stuff, feel the good feeling, as if you want to believe that your problems and miseries are the biggest problems on earth. But it's not. But it's also true that you are only stuck with yourself. The first and foremost thing is your wellbeing but it's asy to be tricked if your world view is small nd not wide enough to have a global view of existence on our pale blue planet. All may be illusion, it's hard to figure what's real and what's not, as most things are beyond your reach and beyond your subjective world. Life should be easy to live. But the baggage from evolution, from culture are too hard and the trap seems to be too tight for any individual to break through. I am on a peak of my personal realizations. Nothing is weird. My mind is mashed with conflicting thoughts. But it's all good. May be whatever you are, where ever you are, accepting and embracing it is the first step, and then the continuation. Being a human is probably lucky that you are uniquely positioned to think through all these. But then a human mind is so tricky, if it's not filled with the positive stuff, if it's not directed towards a good path, it can make a living hell out of itself even in the best livable condition. So, life is a blessing and a curse at the same time; it's ultimately how it's perceived. You can know the light, when you experienced darkness.. and vice versa. If you want to have the same trip like mine...it will be a bad trip for you if you watch these videos sequentially.. . in total I probably watched 50 videos over a long time. Haha. There's also almost infinite good stuff and videos too on YouTube. You can always cherry pick and demand to see the good instead of the bad.

Title: "What is your life changing moment that makes you want to study?

Posting my Quora Q&A on "What is your life changing moment that makes you want to study?" Also Happy mother's day for my mom as she was the main reason. Mother's are the most important person for every child. For me, it's my mom. She spent tremendous amount of time taking care of how I studied, what I studied. She stayed awake late night, created notes, tutorials for me without sleeping. She would feed me before the exams so that I don't lose concentration while studying. She would sleep with me so that I can wake up early during exams even until my age 14. She was never like the other moms of my friends back in junior school who would go talk to the teachers to get suggestions, rather every time I would do bad, she would sit with me to teach me better, she would herself read all my topics, understand everything, made it easy for me. She would investigate so that I learn not only just to pass my exams, but also really learn things by heart which will be stuck with me. I used to hate mathematics, even though all I do now is related to mathematics, she would spend hours until I understand a math concept. She would never give up, sometimes making me crazy. She got me into reading literature, writing, she used to read travelling books, she was a dreamer. Even though my dream was quite different than what she wanted me to be( a doctor actually, but I pursued math, computer science, now earth science), she became very successful in making me a dreamer, a challenger, someone who is not afraid, who never gives up, who breaks but ultimately stands up again. She taught me very well that life is not bed of roses. I am as emotional as her, as expressive as her, as crazy as her. Sometimes I intentionally try not to become like her.. haha. Her life itself was so challenging, coming from a small village to becoming a professional medical surgeon, dragging my dad from the same village to become successful together, later on to teach medical college students in the best medical college in my country. But, because of her dedication for me, my dad, my siblings, her siblings and our family members, she sacrificed her career several times. She could be a full Professor by now, but she put our wellbeing and educational development above all. I probably have hurt her more than anybody else, I still argue with her all the time, but in the end I know who will always be by my side no matter how much I fuck up. She gave her life savings that I used for me and my ex girlfriend so that we could pursue PhD in a different challenging environment in USA. I do a lot of things which may not be accepted by her religious ideologies, somewhat dogmatic controlling attitude, but I know she loves me more than anything else. She loves me in her own way which can be bothering often times, but given that I know everything I have achieved, even learnt to refute her, was because of her. If it was not her, I would probably still be in a small village doing small stuff. She made me dream to chase for the best I could be with my potential. I did my bachelor's in Japan, then I wanted to come to US for my PhD; she never put any familial pressure on me, she encouraged me to pursue higher studies, she encouraged me to choose the toughest economically not very comfortable path so that I can become a scientist, she encouraged me to always be honest, never lie, work hard no matter how much challenging it is. I am now doing a PhD in a field that she doesn't even understand, but yesterday on mother's day, when I called her, she asked me to explain my research to her and she listened all the convoluted complex stuff that I do now. She wants me to be religious which I can never be, she wants me to be a lot of things that I can never me, but on the other hand I have become a lot of things that she wanted me to be, an educated, intelligent, compassionate person. My moments with her, my memories of her pushing me to study, emphasizing on education, seeking for knowledge were one of the greatest reasons I want to study. I know I will keep giving her love with good achievements and distress with the things that she is incapable of understanding due to her knowledge, limited experiences, but I love her a lot too in my own way. Thanks for bearing me Mom. And I know that she will always be with me and will never leave me. May be my sister too. That knowledge itself has made me survive during my bad days. We are emotional sensual being, and these assurance and love really matter. Happy mother's day mom. I will appreciate if you upvote my answer on Quora if you actually liked it. Thank you. https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-life-changing-moment-that-makes-you-want-to-study/answer/Zehady-Abdullah-Khan?share=e53998eb&srid=X0U1

Fundraising Page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/donate/883692651837918/10155375490466860/ A life of an intelligent beautiful girl you can save Hey fellow bloggers, let's save the life of a girl. Definitely you have a big heart and a compassionate shoulder and you can help. This intelligent girl is dying because of cancer (Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia). Her name is Rafa. You can see her innocently smiling on the left of the cover picture of the fundraising page. But then you will feel very sad seeing her terribly struggling with cancer in the right side of the picture. :( She is a cousin of my dear friend. She is quite intelligent. She is actually a medical college student at a private Medical college, who in future, if alive, will become a doctor who will probably save and help hundreds other lives. But she is struggling with her own life now. We already got our first donation from a very special person. :) Keep sharing and posting. I will update with the progress we made. I had contact with the girls family today via messenger and they are extremely happy that we initiated this. I told her to keep smiling. Hope you can help us. M Rezaur Rahman Anup Sarkar It requires around 100,000 USD to have the bone marrow transplant operation. Her dad already spent 30,000 USD and is being totally unable to collect rest of the money which is required to have the operation. And therefore, they are in dire need of any help you can provide. So, let me do the math.. if around 70,000 USD = 7000 * 10 = 700 * 100 = 70 * 1000 = 14,000 * 5 = 70,000 * 1 If only 14,000 people donate 5 $, or 7000 people donate 10 $ or 700 people donate 100 $ on average, or any combination above, that makes it enough to save a life that will live and breathe and enjoy all the great things we enjoy in life. And may be she will turn out to be a really good one among us with all the love she will get from all of you. Are you willing to donate even at least a dollar? I know, people from other places are also collecting money, so I am setting a smaller goal from this page which I may change if there's more interest in helping the beautiful Rafa. If not, would you be willing to share this post so that it can reach as many people as possible? Let me know if you can even help with any small or big amount. If you want to know more about this kid, and other information, please contact me, M Rezaur Rahman Anup Sarkar Money handling transparency: The collected money in the bank account will be transparently shown to all donators. additionally a Google spreadsheet will be kept for money coming from sources other than Facebook. https://docs.google.com/…/1DrV9JLPDFd-dSMJEmSEGn27ESk…/edit… Ultimately the money will be sent to the bank account of the father of the girl you can see in the cover picture. Later updates will be posted pre and post operation of the girl. We hope to see the girl smile again.

Title: Breathing in an agnostic life

We love to hang out with other people. We love to feel safe. If we don't have friends, if we feel rejected, if we feel unsafe, unimportant, we feel to die and in the extreme level, some take the decision to suicide. It doesn't always need to have a religious origin as both religious and non-religious people suicide. For example, the suicide rate in Japan or Sweden (highly non-religious) is very high. But it's easily understandable why a non-religious person can feel secluded, feel rejected, feel unsafe, feel unimportant in a religious community. So, for a non-religious person, just being non-religious, being knowledgeable about science and facts are not enough, they need to develop self-love, need to develop high interpersonal skills which go beyond anybody's religiosity, may be need to try to be less argumentative and understandable about irrational human mind and psychology. It doesn't matter what other people are determined of doing if you know very well about your own determination. But that requires a strong will power that takes time to develop and I know a lot of people, even myself very often don't or can't have it. But I strongly stand by these existentialistic/nihilistic/stoicist approach towards life that I learnt from Sartre, Neitzsche, Kahlil Gibran and other philoshophers. And I hope to continue to learn and grow and live amidst differences of all kinds with a smile in my face. So, it's not sin at all to trust and value your own strength. If you are not always thinking about God or Agnosticism/Atheism all the time, if you are the person who will not be bothered by every single religious bullshit you hear and can just lightly ignore the shallow talks to focus on good interpersonal relationship based on momentary smiles and joys, if you are involved with some of the plenty of fun activities like sports, dance, dining, kayaking, hiking, biking, running, video games, book reading, blogging, vlogging, cooking, yoga, arts, music and are willing to know passionate people who are involved with these activities and can share their passion, I don't see why you won't be able to subside the religiosity or religious conversation. And I don't know how even a religious people can avoid such an interesting person like you. So, be interesting, be fun, be friendly, talk important things with those who may understand the importance, you will never be out of friends. But still you will often feel lonely like I am feeling in this morning coz I am far away from my family and haven't met them for over 4 years and lots of other personal issues and insecurities. But I know I will move my ass to make my day as fun as possible. I make my day and I try hardest not to allow anyone to ruin my moments and my peace of mind even if they try hard. And I can tell you that most of my religious friends don't dislike me, if not love me. Only one life we got. Enjoy with everyone ! And those can't appreciate who you are after all these, why will we even waste a single bit of seconds thinking about them? We do because we are human, but may be we should not sometimes and let those feelings leave.

Title: The volatile Bitcoin

Content:
Technical Analysis of last 300 days of Bitcoin price data. The top rectangangular frame shows the bar chart(green and orange bars) of the bitcoin price. A bar chart represents the OHLC(open, high, low, close) price for a time period (in this case 1 day) for an asset/stock/cryptocoin. Bollinger Band: You can see a band (the dotted red lines above and below and a grey line in between) around the bitcoin OHLC price. The grey line represents the average price of 20 days. When the bars are above the grey line, the price is being appreciated, when the bars are below the grey line, the price is being depreciated. Relative Strength Index(RSI): The blue line in second rectangular frame below shows RSI. Relative strength index(RSI) represents when the bitcoin has been overbought (more bought than being sold --> leads to price hike) or when the bitcoin has been oversold (more sold than being bought --> leads to price drop). When the blue RSI line is abobe 80 (check in the left y axis), it's normally overbought (price rise) and you can see direct correlation of price hike comparing with the price chart above, when the blue RSI line is below 20, it's normally oversold (price drop). You can see, right now everyone is panicking and everyone is selling, nobody almost is buying, so price is dropping rapidly. Bitcoin has hit the lowest RSI value of the year. Moving Average Convergence Divergence(MACD): The third rectangular frame below shows MACD value with grey bars, grey dotted line and a red dotted line. The red dotted line is the average price of 26 days and the grey dotted line is the average price of 12 days. When the grey line is above the red line, it means that the short term price is higher than the long term price, but when it is below, it means that current price is being depreciated from the long term accepted price. MACD is another momentum oscillator which is similar to RSI. You can directly see how it is similar by comparing them. It's probably easier to read the MACD chart than the RSI. Because there's the zero line (in RSI it probably represents the value 50) when the grey bars are above(upwards) zero line, it means price appreciation, versus when the grey bars are below zero line(downwards), it means price depreciation. As you can see the price is highly depreciated now. Commodity Channel Index (CCI): The fourth rectangular frame below shows CCI value with red line and filled red polygons. If in between 100 and -100, the price is not taking any huge turn (bull ride or bear drop). The filled polygons above 100 show the extreme price hike, where as the polygons below -100 show the recent extreme price drop. Because of these polygons, it's very easy to see the price movement with CCI index. Hope you enjoyed learning some of the common techniques used to understand market price.

Title: Some thoughts and conversations on Veganism
Published Date: Thu, 14 Jun 2018 15:45:41 +0000
Categories & Tags: Home, Life, Living, Veganism, life, morality, philosophy, vegan
Content:
I had some heated conversation over this Earthling Ed video. Just sharing my thoughts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3SXwteti-4 Just imagine(not necessarily hypothetical), one day an intelligent and superior alien species conquer the earth and enslave all human being. And a 25 year old Alien who loves human meat says "I wish a perfectly cooked human flesh and human tongue and liver wasn't so delicious. I know they feel when we throw them on the slaughter house but ooh.. I cant stop having pleasure from eating my delicious food. Yummy." This is why morality is objective. You try to approach a scenario by putting your ownself in there. The assumption that you are superior and thus you can abuse is morally wrong. Now whether you want to be moral or not is totally up to you. But you are being immoral by killing sentient being is a fact. The problem is you can not feed meat or dairy products through milk etc. to the 7 billion people on earth by having cattle farm everywhere, ultimately you will have to have animal farming. My grandma own couple cattle farms and I grew up playing with them. So, definitely having a cattle farm is way better and more ethical. But veganism is more like a movement where vegans are making a statement that "in our modern world we can perfectly live and breath by having plant based diet, and we have no necessity to live on meat based protein and put these mammals, reptiles, our fellow creatures in to pain just for our pleasure of taste in the tongue." It's hard to teach morality, isn't it? We used to have slaves and beat the hell out of them, rape slave women just few years ago.. and it was perfectly legal, vouched by religious scriptures.. that's why a simple moral test is always asking yourself before doing the action "Would you like that to happen to yourself?" That's where compassion and humanism and a better world origin from. So..point valid everywhere.. even in a new dimensional world or even in the deep past or even in present. Aren't plants as living beings feel pain too... double standards? These are common things been said towards veganism which just indicates how little people think or know about life and biology. Plant does not have brain and central nervous system. Mammals are not the same as reptilians and amphibians, reptilians are not the same as fungi or plants. There's a hierarchy in the mechanism of pain. A crocodile or a hippopotamus won't feel anything on their thick skin if you punch hard, but try that on a human or a dog or a cow. What is pain is a neurological question. What is suffering is a cosmic consciousness question. Yes, plants suffer, but do plants feel pain on the same level a mamal brain which evolved over 500 million years in the 4.8 billion year old history of earth? The answer is no. It's plain biology and you need to read some literature on the evolution of pain and what nervous centres actually cause it. One intuition I can give, if a person is paralyzed in one leg, you can try punching, pinning, he won't feel pain from there. But definitely on the consciousness level, plants suffer as they have life. So, I understand where you are coming from. In an ideal buddhist world, they prefer not even killing plants. If I would be able to survive well without killing plants, I actually would prefer to do that as that's what the same moral code suggests. What I mean by that is that if you are in a living condition, where you no longer have other option but to kill an animal, morally you are right to kill for your survival. So, you couldn't be a vegan in antarctica or arctic sea where your only option is some seals and fishes. So, morality also definitely depends on cultural evolution and understanding, but on a very firm and simple objective which is "How can we reduce suffering and pain in the world as it is apparently not pleasant". Hope that answers your doubt. But also read more about what I am saying in philosophy and biology and earth and human history. You don't need to take my words! Let's be compassionate as we have reached far and are truly progressing towards a compassionate world little by little amidst all the bullshits, wars and nightmares. And innocent animals can be included in your circle of compassion too..  ;) "Thanks for the short budhist training. But no, it is still your view of the world and it’s valid but so is mine. I decided to put and limit my moral compass on human’s feelings and suffering I have little feelings for unknown rabbits living in a random cave in India. I guess your philosophy will be more telling for individualistic monk in a spiritual quest trying to feel compassion in everyone and everything in the universe (ironically so often excluding his/her close family). That’s one way to live a life but certainly not the best way if there is one." Yep, totally valid question. No, the wolves are not immoral because wolves don't understand morality, wolves don't have the ethical evolution about what it means to be right or wrong. That's one way of answering it. Another answer is wolves are carnivorous, they can only eat meat, they can't live on plants. But the giant apes, our ancestors, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangotans are 95% herbivorous, and only 5% carnivours meaning they sometimes enjoy meat or insects. So, we are actually omnivorous, but we are more herbivorous than carnivorous.. we forcefully are evolving ourselves to becoming carnivorous. You can see in the literature of medical science, how carcinozens cause cancer, what's the main root of heart disease etc. But anyway, you can totally have a healthy carnivorous diet. So, from the morality standpoint, wolves haven't written books on morality, wolves haven't understoon peace, they don't held nobel peace prize conference. Now whether some people are like wolves, definitely they are.. ;) whether it's better to be like a peaceful bonobo than a violent chimpanzee, I think that leads towards a peaceful society. Whether you use atomic energy to bring power plants, versus whether you nuke hiroshima.. we totally have the choice of both. But we understand from physical pain/suffering perspective and also from the empirical evidence from the past, what causes less suffering to life.. "And if your logic is applied to the current world veganism is still a luxury morality which is my main point. It cannot be universal at least in the present state of the world. I will leave it here since I can smell that this topic passionates you to the maximum. Hope we’ll have more time to discuss. I’d like to have a deeper understanding of budhism from someone who practice it on a daily basis. 😉" Whether others are not doing anything to bring less suffering shouldn't prevent you. If you can be luxarious in the right direction, then be it. May be Einstein had the luxury to think about gravitational pull, theory of relativity when most people were just pulling carts in the world. So are other scientists.. Guess what, that brought everything we enjoy today, including me texting on fb on internet. So are most of the peace prize winners, when nobody cared, they gave their sweats to bring fairness in the world. They weren't always right. After all we are fallible human beings. But if our intuition tells that something should be done to reduce suffering of animals, and if it's just to sacrificing my eating habit a little, I will do. And you are right. These are luxurious, but somebody had to do it. If they wouldn't the world would still be the barbaric world from the past where we would be roaming around on horses with swords or guns in both sides of our cowboy pants and would totally chop heads every time some one argue with us. Haha.. I hope you get the point. Definitely luxurious, but what you understand to be right is always in your hand to be executed immediately. You always have the choice not to do either and flow with the usual tide. After all forcing morality on to others is also immoral which is paradoxical, now I am playing word games.. haha. :)

I woke up, I was feeling not so great. Then I did yoga, today's lesson was kind of intense. I sweated a lot, but then I felt good. I walked up to the coffee shop, and I am listening John Bellion and shaking my head. I have been under quite much pressure due to my research work, I really need to be productive this summer. And I should never cease to smile. I think I deserve more love from my own self. I love this picture of mine.  ☺️ #happypath #summerday

"To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering." Guess what !! Nietzsche is almost always right. And Westworld is blowing me again and again. Just watched the recent episodes. Had to dig some explanations to really understand. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9kwaPFKcEs Nietzsche writes that man’s problem “was not suffering itself, but that there was no answer to the crying question, ‘why do I suffer' ... The meaninglessness of suffering, not suffering itself, was the curse that lay over mankind so far—” Natural selection is optimized for survival, not enjoyment. Once you understand that, an awful lot of stuff makes sense. No wonder we behave in ways that make us miserable -- so long as we pass our genes on, our misery is of no account. Nietzsche's implication is that you cannot survive meaningless suffering unless you can find meaning. Finding meaning means the creation of values that structure life and make it possible to live in spite of "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune". That's how religion, desire, goals, accomplishment, sense of enlightenment - everything has originated ultimately. (Some cut paste from agnostic and youtube.) But profound. Isn't it?

I feel like I am a bag of emotions. This emotional roller coaster is not something that I dislike, but sometimes I just get confused about myself. Because I don't know why I should be feeling what I am feeling. I start it new, then it gets old too soon. I know that I can pinpoint the root of each branch of my gigantic emotional tree, but some leaves just outgrow and outgrow and make me feel like I have nothing to say about my own journey. But why do I even feel to say? So, I let them grow, but then I feel boggled. I feel scared unnecessarily. I know the origin of fear, I know the outcome of fear, I know the future of fear, but still, the fear is there which is redundant. I know it's all about being an open door through which things will pass. The moment you try to catch, you yourself are caught. I doubt my feelings all the time, maybe I just couldn't find a better word than doubt here. Maybe a better way to say is that I want to judge my feelings, but then that's probably not a good idea? Then why do I do it after knowing this is something I can't comprehend. Maybe I didn't learn anything so far, maybe it will be like this forever, and I will have to just go through, pass through, write through and dig through every morning like I am doing.  It's like having self within self within self and ad infinitum. I know that I can not choose and pick just the ones I like. But the desire to stay unsullied, remain on a path is probably a struggle as there are so many paths to choose. All I did is just I walked. I started from my home and I walked to the coffee shop, then I walked again and I reached the destination. But these few minutes my mind has roamed the entire universe of my emotional tree. It's like reflecting a zillion of light all at once towards me, but all I wanted is to just walk without feeling anything. All I hoped that I would just bathe in the sunshine of the morning and my mind will just not let me do that. And I know why, and I know everything. But as I tell myself always knowing doesn't help and in fact trap me more. So, I scream like Led Zeppelin, that you can not hold me find my stairway to heaven. And I will create new rules and then I will be chained under my own jail again. And I live.

As if that obviousness wasn't enough! From far, it still looked like a shadow, Some doubts thus still lingered, On your lips there's no answer yet. Couldn't those moments be bit more expressive? If those clouds wouldn't hide anything! What more there to be naked? It can't be more both calm and restless and therefore inviting. Let's not let it be dry, 'Coz you can always catch and stop time. Or you can choose to fly like a butterfly often with no intention. To lose can't be a sin. We'd rather embrace and sweat with our yearnings. This mystery and you, here I breathe, A little inception in the now is what I only long for. The deep urge of this urgency can be welcomed. Then take a shower in the drops of uneasiness. And curl me inside with your legs. More incidents will not precipitate more love. It's impossible to find discontinuity with an open eye. And I won't stop drinking you. Image source: Google images.

Because my car broke down a month ago, I couldn't do it. But then I just decided all on a sudden on Friday that I should be at Chicago on Saturday. Why does it always have to be such hasty decision for me? Like everything. I will just have to decide in the last moment! Haha, I am such a freak. Well, I have been busy and occupied with lots of new things. So, it was kinda hard to take some time out. Anyway, I had fun breathing some fresh air in this late summer. My friend and I did some photo shoots, it was my first ever photo shoot. It's not that easy to open up in front of camera. Isn't it?

I gave them the gun, And they dropped me dead. My eyes were wide and open To see the void of affection in their face. The short interval between The triggering and the bullet reaching my heart Cut all the ties and kill everything vague; Between that very moment And all that is rest. I wonder how easy it is to be swept away from the brightness to the jungle of nothingness. Time is a puzzle that I still can't solve. It comes, it swerves, it slides; It twists and then it vanishes From my inside and out. I remember those wild nights That made me brave; Just when the bullet was touching me To drop me dead. I realized only then my fate, But I'll live forever In the air and in the ears I can bet.

I just finished reading Haruki Murakami's "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle". Just wrote my experience as my review on goodreads: In short "A genuinely outstanding experience". This is how I read it- I started on Thursday. I finished on Monday and I don't know what went on in this world in between. I think just like Mr. Wind-up bird, I was stuck in my own well as I was recovering from my own darkness. I could see through the events like they were happening right within me. I got terrorized, I got shaken, I got enthusiastic, I was trying to find my baseball bat to find the strength in me. I was trying to find meaning, I was trying to find solace, but I was just being thrown into even more void, but eventually, I was feeling stronger and stronger; braver and braver. I could know love in a much more deeper place in my heart, I could learn how to let go, I could learn how to be not afraid amidst big walls that are suffocating me. I can replay the entrance and exit of each character on the scenes of my mental stage. Some were pushing me, some were pulling me. And in the end, I was wound up. But I think I discovered more than ever at the same time.

Title: In search of meaning or not?

Content:
Birth was not a choice, but living life should be and is a choice. There is no inherent one meaning for life, just because there is no one way of living life. Your meaning of life should adhere to your way of living life. However, the space where our lives are contained is a shared space. Therefore, we create some rules to abide by so that our distinct subjectivities don't collide up to the point that we crush (which unfortunately is happening). The ordinary monkey way of living has evolved in such a way that we let these rules rule our inner selves so much that we can't find our inner selves anymore and everything feels like a burden. Life feels meaningless. Think about it.. when you were a child, you were mindlessly roaming everywhere, probably was not giving a damn about the meaning of life. Then why do you give so much damn about meaning now? Because we are just bored, everything feels the same, we can't change things, we feel helpless, we can't create, we don't know where we are heading, it all looks like a fog. But I can argue that if you can start thinking like a baby again, you will see you would feel differently. But I know it's not easy. Time is a forward-moving trajectory. So, if you choose to live, it's probably better to live the way your mind and body is in a union which then generate joy and fulfillment. There are some known facts from past experiences, scientific discoveries through neuroscience, yogic science, what can lead to the betterment of health and mind that we can follow to live longer and happier. Even though your body shares a lot of genetic memory, your mind already inherited a lot of baggage from the past, it's probably always better to believe in the fluid nature of mind that can change and strive towards bringing good for you and others. And if you definitely need a meaning for yourself to move forward, just create one. I believe in taking the full responsibility for this life I am carrying.

My diet is 90% veggies... No plans to reduce meat consumption anymore than this... Nov 9, 2018 Reply  1 AnandaKhan  replied Nov 9, 2018 0 Why not? If we personally feel horrible to kill something in our own hands and then process and eat, may be we should not cause the pain in the first place in a living sentient being for the pleasure in our mouth. We probably don't need to breed something that we then subject to cruelty. Probably we are just indoctrinated since our childhood with the lure of taste of meat in a meat culture, just like a baby becomes indoctrinated in a religious home. And why all the greens of the earth need to be processed through these three primary animals (chicken, cow, goat) as intermediaries to provide nutrient where as you can derive that directly from the earth and plants. And why taking the moral responsibility if you can think that way? And why being part of environmental destruction in the process? If we can reduce 90%, we can 100%. And if we absolutely can't get away from this indoctrination, there exists artificial meat to consume which more and more in time will taste exactly the real ones. Hope you get what I am saying. Cutiebeauty  replied Nov 9, 2018  0 @AnandaKhan I've butchered and slaughtered my own before. I have no problem with it... I'm doing my part by eating 10% meat. If everyone did this it would be a bigger impact than me going 100% veggie. When I do eat meat its usually chicken and fish. And the only reason I eat mostly veggies is because I like veggies. AnandaKhan  replied Nov 9, 20180 @Cutiebeauty Well, that means you very well know the pain in those "you butchered and slaughtered" and the fear in their eyes and the groaning came out of their bodies when you performed the act. I guess you didn't care as you have experienced others doing it while you grew up and your desire for the flesh is much more important for you than the pain you are causing. Anyway, if such pain and suffering in sentient being can't stop you doing what you are doing, all argument of mine will probably fail. Noone can butcher and slaughter their beloved dog to acquire flesh which probably means we can only butcher and slaughter ones we don't love. So, I guess human being has a limited circle of compassion and love and they butchered and slaughtered many other human beings for their own selfish reasons in the past; again I guess they didn't love them, in fact hated them. I hope someday people can expand their circle of compassion and love even more. We already made progress and may be we can make even more progress and keep all sentient beings in our circle of compassion and love. So, I will stop but I will just urge to think and read more. Thank you. Source: www.agnostic.com

Published Date: Tue, 13 Nov 2018 23:39:55 +0000
Categories & Tags: Home, Life, Living, Road
Content:
So I was crossing the road. I was in this side. And the guy was in the other side. It wasn't a crowdy crossing. At that very moment no car was passing by. But the "walk" sign was still not showing up. There were two, three more passers by just came to the other side of the crossing. I decided to cross the road and the other guy decided not to as he was waiting for the "walk" sign. I broke the traffic rule. But it's trivial as most will deem to be done as you can't see any car within hundreds of feets chasing towards the crossing. The passers by who just reached also followed me and we crossed. But the guy was still waiting for the "walk" sign to show up. I'm pretty sure the thought of crossing road has passed through his mind too. But he was adament to not break the rule. Even when the people behind him left him behind, he didn't move. I wasn't sure whether it was me or the people from his side made him more determined to not cross the road. If there weren't people from his side crossing with me, would he attempt to cross after I finished crossing? Was it that he just couldn't cross the road after me because he already has shown the others that he is following rules and now if he breaks the rule, it makes his prior abidance of the rule questioned. Is it the observer effect of some sort? Then I thought a lot of other social scenarios where you probably would break the rule if there weren't any to observe you. Or is it that the guy was just lazy and cautious and that's what we are expected to do and I have just plenty of time to think.. Rules are there for a reason. I feel grey.

Every waking moment, we are experiencing. It is so obvious but it still takes a little stepping back to recognize. When I am conscious, my consciousness is filled with thoughts of various colors. We are all so colorful inside if we can assign a different color to each of the different emotion that we experience. We don't feel the same way and that's what makes the difference; because each of us had different experiences through our senses in a unique path in the environment. It's like different colored, different sized bubbles in an open shared space. Each of us is like a bubble that expands, that pops. Bubbles collide with each other, merge, crash. It's constantly changing. As long as the mind is active, it continues to interpret in its own way. In the physical world, we need a few requirements to survive. But on top of our physical reality, we created the emotional reality that we don't really understand properly. All the accumulated genetic, environmental memories imprinted in our bodies and minds may be a little too much to grasp all at once. But ultimately all of it make who I am, who you are, who they are. It doesn't require to understand every single thing to live, just like it doesn't require to notice every single object on a road to navigate through the road. There are no ends of knowing. So, the quest of knowing ultimately becomes narrow based on what you are seeking for. I just realize every day how integral love is to our existence. This intense emotion that we receive the moment we are born from our mother, we never stop seeking it. Of course in our own way, we have our own understanding of what love means to us. You probably have all heard about Freud. Basically, all he is saying is that the portion of our conscious mind that we are in control of or we think we control is just the tip of the iceberg. There's a huge hidden body under the surface of the water that is invisible. The unconscious mind is that huge hidden body that constructs the emotional network inside us, that in turn make us feel in a certain way in a certain moment and make us do actions. Because it is quite unfathomable, we remain a mystery to our own selves. And I guess we would probably not enjoy knowing everything either. But the seeking to dig deeper, get wetter with our emotional fuel should be welcomed. Desire. The desire to be loved, desire to be seen, desire to be respected, desire to be visible, the constant changes in our desires. Where do all these desires come from? Sometimes I ask whether I can live without desires. Maybe I could if I didn't have a physical body which wants food, sex, cravings to be touched, longings to be exhibited in a preferential way. Who am I talking to right now? Is there a listener within me that I am talking to, is there a reader within me I am writing to? I recognize all these entities need not be isolated. Maybe they are all one constructing the self that I can recognize and call "me". Or maybe not as I can't really explain all the unconscious processes inside me. My problems are very simple to understand. I need food, I need sex, I need love. And that's why I work. But I am uncomfortable when I don't get them the way I want. But it's so easy to see why I can never get them the way I want. And when I realize that my problems vanish. But sometimes I am just blind, and sometimes I am just stubborn and try not to see. About 30 years. So many days I have lived. Why does it need to be so complex to live the next day? It's not that different after all. It is just not complex at all. All you need is to just live.

Title: Some thoughts on the inequality of Bitcoin ownership

Content:
Even if I am a proponent of Bitcoin, this bothers me. When Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned bitcoin as a payment protocol for everyone, one computer one vote, he was definitely unable to see how capitalism and the already accumulated money will also accumulate Bitcoin. I personally don't identify myself as a capitalist, I actually dislike capitalism on many grounds, but at the same time, I know why and how it works, it's not that there are many alternatives in the world. I understand Marxist, communist and socialist ideas but I fail to see how it can propel creativity and drive to move forward and change. It's like a tradeoff and that's why I probably like social democracy where they envision a balance of both. But with imperfection. Money is power and powerful always concentrate power and money for their own gains. Equal opportunity ought to be established but equal outcome we can never guarantee. The tension is always there. The concentration of Bitcoin in few places or few hands or few organizations go against the spirit of Bitcoin, as by protocol it is decentralized. But the fact is it is centralized in the big hands and this is the only reason I have against Bitcoin. And maybe that's why I don't believe completely that Bitcoin will be a currency for the future. I view it as a digital asset like digital gold which will be used as a store of value. But Bitcoin has shown us how money or value system or payment system can be created without a central money-making machine. I do believe that Bitcoin is better than government currency. I am against the spirit of nationalism and I think the national borders won't make sense after few millennia and we will appreciate a global currency like Bitcoin. So, ultimately I want to say, Bitcoin will be there. But probably there will be a better currency which can surpass Bitcoin and which will probably not centralized. But then again that is Marxist, libertarian or anarchyst part of my brain talking. As I can see how capitalism is reigning in our world by the power, for the power, with the powerful, who knows Bitcoin might be the winner. Anyway, just some thoughts. I am not an astrologer who predicts future. I speculate and I miss. The ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin also doesn't believe in proof of work anymore. So, there are smart people who are already thinking about better solution already. That's always our best bet for survival. Isn't it? We need an einstein, we need a Nicola Tesla, we need few scientists, we need probably a work and innovation machine like Elon musk as most of us are just fooling around. Well, it's too much for one little brain sometimes. http://www.marsfinance.net/newsdetail/20181226215040947451.html https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2019/01/less-than-1-of-bitcoin-addresses-control-nearly-87-of-btc-s-supply-analysis-finds/

I: I like that you like to live in the moment. You: We are always living in a moment. What do you mean? You think you are not living in the moment? I: True. But what I mean is that if I am doing things now for something that I expect to happen in a future moment, am I living in the moment? I am bit confused. You: Of course you are still living in the moment. But you probably don't feel like living in the moment. I: But if I am not feeling to be living in the moment, am I truly living in the moment? Isn't there a distinction between fact and fiction? Or is it that everything is fiction? You: It can be that everything is a fiction. I: No, our reality, the world outside us might not be a fiction. Pain might not be a fiction. Death might not be a fiction. I am not sure about pleasure though. Pleasures can be fictitious. I don't know.. You seem to be living in the moment whereas I can't really claim it like that. Or I should say I don't feel to claim it like that. I tend to feel that I know what is ahead of me. At least I can have a good prediction of that based on my prior experience. But I am relying on my thinking mind and my collected knowledge and my instinct. You: But don't you ever wonder to start your day like you are a newborn baby? I: I actually do. You: Have you asked yourself why you have that desire to be reborn? Is it because you are burdened with your past? I: It can be. But I'd say it's not as simple as that. You: I saw an episode of Black Mirror the other day. One thing kind of struck me. They were saying that memory is a way to trigger you to get back to your past to change your path. I have never thought it that way? I: In a way it's true. Especially if you are taking an action based on your memory. Isn't it? (to be continued ..)

You and I - 1 : https://experienceandembrace.wordpress.com/2019/01/23/you-and-i/ I: It's snowing outside. You: Yeah, it's beautiful how everything is covered. I: What do you think about "Deja Vu"? You: Like you feel that it happened before? I: Yeah, it's been happening to me quite a lot. And it makes me feel bored. You: But, does that matter though? What's wrong with experiencing it again? Is the desire to constantly be in a new situation the best for our psyche? I: I don't know. That's what everybody is up to. Isn't it? New is exciting- they say. You: That's the problem I think. If you can't perceive every moment as new, rather always perceive it as a reincarnated old, then you are just living inside your mind too much, circling and ultimately destined to diminish into a point of meaninglessness. I: You are right. Every moment is a new one. It's a perception issue, but the issue is real. The boredom is inevitably there to drown. You: Well, then you recognized it. I: But it doesn't help though. You: Maybe it will. Hope is necessary. I: You want to play with snow? You: Sure. As you know, you will really be playing with yourself. I: I have seen some beautiful pictures of places. I really want to go visit them when I can. You: Nice. What kind? I: Mostly beautiful natural places. Most of the time there are some beautiful people waving or walking or doing something. It's just refreshing to see. I guess it will be great to be there for real breathing the air near the ocean, over the mountain, through the valley, highways. You: Yeah, escaping creates the euphoria. Maybe for good. I: I know. You: You remember that you wanted to know about love? I: Yes. What about it? You: Do you think there's an ocean of love or a sky of love? I: I will choose air over water. Just a preference. I don't know how to swim. You: You don't know how to fly either. At least you can learn to swim. I: You see, you are too pragmatic. In my imagination, I want to fly. I don't crave to dive into the water. You: Right you are! You want things that you can not have. Just saying.. I: Good. Now I am pissed. You: Haha. Like you always are. (to be continued ..)

You: I think so. But I think some lies might have been necessary. I: Maybe. But when I know I was lied to, I feel differently towards those words I were told. You: Well, feelings are weird creatures within. Aren't they? How much do you think you understand how you feel. Rationale, on the other hand, gives you a way of reviewing them. If you see the utility of those lies, you might forgive me. Not that I care. I: So, you are saying I needed to be in the delusion that very moment. Because you presupposed that I can't handle the truth. That's too much of an arrogance I would say. You: You caught the asshole. But again I did it for what I felt right to do at that moment. I: Well, acknowledge that you may have done a big mistake with your rational thoughts, your bag of ill-conceived ideas of me and my abilities. You: I will have to think. Just calm down. I: Okay. How do you stop craving something? You: Depends on what you crave I guess. What do you crave? I: I crave to recreate one memory. It's this one time - I was with the girl I loved. It was in her apartment. She just came on top of me. I undressed her on the top and I kissed her breasts and she was holding my head. She was full of pleasure but she was calm like she was wanting it more and more. I have been with other girls after that, even probably tried to recreate with my feelings of guilt. But I no longer could, I never could feel the same way. I felt like I need her to recreate it, but I know it's not possible. Maybe even with her. It's probably will never be possible again. But I can't stop craving. And every time I fail to recreate, I feel miserable. You: It's a memory you hold very dear to yourself. You know that you can't recreate it so you will have to compartmentalize it. Somehow.. you will have to do it. Cravings are good. Just don't let them kill you. You have seen the movie inception, right? Leonardo De Caprio's wife Mal haunts him in his dreams. She is in his subconscious and he gets back to her through the elevator where she resides. Maybe because he can't forgive himself. Nor is he willing to let the memories evaporate. He confines her, thus he gets himself confined even more ruthlessly. Do you think you might be doing the same? I: Not intentionally as far as I can say. I started to realize that my desires are my enemies. You: Because you can't befriend them for some reasons. But that's dreadful. You will have to be friends with them. I: I see the futility in the harmony that you are asking me to have. Maybe I love chaos. Maybe that's where I thrive. You: It's a choice ultimately. That's just what I want you to know. (to be continued ..)

Title: Bitcoin and a new world

I have coffee in Starbucks or Vienna everyday which cost me around 3-5$. And so do most of my friends here in US. This world has 7.8 billion people now. Out of them, about 3 billion people live below the poverty line which is around 3$. Every time I buy coffee, I never think about this. The realization that despite of all the wealth and innovation happening in this world, almost half of the population are unbanked, have no access to internet, world market, late alone credit card. I don't envision that Bitcoin will solve the problem of poverty. But Bitcoin showed how currency can exist outside the realm of political and economic power which systemize the wealth hierarchy, define the line between poor and rich. Bitcoin has proven that a currency can be created out of the interest of people's desire to trade between each other, definitely it happened because of the advent of computer, internet, open source software, you name it. I know it's been speculated now as asset, get rich quick scheme (frankly I am also holding and speculating). Most general people are scared of the volatility, but I am talking about the core ideas that Satoshi Nakamoto had when he combined the idea of cryptocurrency and supply-demand economics for creating a digital currency for the world. Bitcoin movement is more than just money or a new innovation, it has the power of shifting the world. And that's why I am a believer in a decentralized currency and frankly I don't know how it will unravel in future and frankly nobody knows. Bitcoin will probably never be a currency, but it has shown the possibility. But it's revolutionary to think that, every region in the world in future will have their own local cryptocurrency, born outside of politics and manipulation and the unbanked of the world have access to the economy. Well, there will always probably be politics, greed, manipulation; after all, we are sometimes just bunch of animals trying to beat each other for our own gains!! lol.. but I am looking at the big picture. I don't envision a utopia but definitely I can see a better world. Also do you know what's happening in Venezuela, everybody in Venezuela is buying Bitcoin because of the corruption of the government and the inflation. The problem is that it's not that government is bad, ultimately we the people put officials there. It's just that power and institutionalization corrupts mind and stagnates. We need a balance of the both, we need education, we need democracy, we need distribution of wealth and power. And as everyone says, it always depends on "Where is the money?" And Bitcoin showed but may be will be proven indirectly by many crypto currency movements over the future years, that money can exist outside of what we used to call money. And it's mind boggling but we are living through the history that the future will talk about.

Title: Why Bitcoin gains value?
Published Date: Fri, 01 Mar 2019 08:56:08 +0000
Categories & Tags: Home
Content:
You need to know what this chart is. The supply of Bitcoin is an exponentially decreased process. Every 4 years the amount of Bitcoin generated in every 10minutes get halved. That means, with equal amount of effort, you will make twice as less Bitcoin now than you could four years ago. This is one of the fundamentals of deflationary economics or Kynesian economics which is quite the opposite of the inflationary modern economic world that we live in. It's the chart about supply and demand. Why is Gold or any asset like a house in real estate become more valuable over time, where as on the other hand, my 2000$ 1997 Nissan Sentra is pretty much 0$ in 2019 and prolly will cost me money instead to throw it to junk yard. So, in brief, some stuff in our economy gain value, and some stuff lose value like your clothes, every electronic or home appliances you buy.. the moment you buy, you just crush its value. But things like stocks, lands, bonds can gain value.. not guaranteed, but they do based on economic dynamics. But a crucial reason behind value gains are the characteristics of rarity. If something is precious, and demanded by more people but the supply is controlled, then based on the demand, that will gain value. Now "why will demand of something rise?"- that question depends on the real world utility, innovation factor, excitement factor etc. Every time you ask this question, just simply close your eyes and realize that there were no internet, no facebook before 1990s, and why on Earth are you interested in Facebook, late alone reading this article on your favorite browser.. may be.. may be you will find your own favorite answer for such questions. However, whenever we are talking about value gains in future, there will always be "speculation" involved. But realize that you always speculate about future.. are you not speculating that tomorrow will be good? How do you know that it will be good? May be you have an exam and you know that it will be stressful. So, ultimately, you have some indicator in your mind, in the market to tell why you can speculate on something and why you can not. So, now if you can understand the principal that I am talking about and can understand the chart and if, only if, Bitcoin and other crypto currency continue to hold their promise of being the digital gold and drive the innovation for the future, you know.. how the chart will tend to look like in future. And I hope you can tip me in future for telling you now.https://reddit.app.link/bC7ZSwZjHU

This Malawi movie "The boy who harnessed the wind" blew my mind. As a scientist of the future, it's always hard to explain in simple terms what a scientific mind does. In school, we go and learn all those physics, chemistry, math, calculus, draw all those complex looking pictures and then we forget what all these fucking science jargons are and what they are for. A lot of us even start hating science as they don't find it relevant or their lack of understanding frightens them. And for a lot, it goes against their own agenda! But it's all about our survival on earth and our progressive understanding of how nature works- we sometimes forget. Science provides the best evidence based tool that has transformed our society. This little boy saved the life of hundreds in his small village by creating a simple wind mill where people were dying, starving , stealing and killing each other for food. Nature didn't pour rain upon them for years and they were not being able to grow crops. He was expelled from the school because his dad couldn't pay for the fees. But he was running through the wind, he knew the power of the wind, he discovered how his science teacher's bicycle has a light which is powered by the manual rotation of the bicycle wheel using a Dynamo. He then could use a fan to power a radio, he could then convince his dad to scrape their only bicycle to make a windmill that saved lives of the villagers. Social entrepreneurship. But against everybody's will, against everybody's judgment. He experimented in hand, he sneaked into the school library and learnt the science. In the core, he wanted to solve a problem. The problem of hunger. And it saddens me when thousands of people mindlessly cut trees, take actions for their own selfish greed and lead this and the next generation to disaster. We are seeing all with climate deniers, flat Earth believers, with the science of genetics and so many others. Most people go against something new that they haven't seen before, they are bad at anticipating. It takes few scientific minds but I wish people were more open to simply explore the new.

I: I am thinking about the cycle of life. Imagine a mammoth tree; it starts from a seed planted on earth; then it grows to be a small plant; it gets taller, bigger and wider; it branches out, takes more space, becomes the nest of some birds, provides the shadows to the passersby; but one day after many years it die; it can no longer maintain its life. You: So is the life of most animals and the human too. Is it not? I: Yeah. I just realized that a full cycle of life has its peak and its valley. Let's say when you were born you were in a valley, then you walked, walked, walked all the way up to the peak of a mountain, then you must have to come back to the valley in the other side. What is striking me the most is that it's not a choice to stay either on the peak or the valley of the landscape. Time is forcing you to move and there is no constancy. You: We are just experiencers experiencing life. I: Then why do we attach ourselves too much to anything at all? Like our parents, our house, our babies, our career, our achievements, our this, our that. You: Because at many moment in life, you have things or relationships which are replaceable and things or relationships which are irreplaceable. You are right that we delude ourselves with many of our assumptions and false expectations. But at the same time we require a certain purpose for us to live and move on the path from the valley to the peak, to the valley again. Many actually never reach the peak, many die on the way to the valley. There is probably no one exact peak either. I: Life is confusing to me often times. I drive myself to achieve things, to go to places, to desire. I do things to make myself happy. But there are many things that make me unhappy. There are many desires that will never be fulfilled. But if I don't chase, I will never achieve, right? But the process of chasing is tiring and makes me unhappy. Every rejections, failures break my heart, but when I stand up again, I become stronger. But there is probably no end of this cycle. Just like the day ends with a night and a night ends with a day. Or, a night starts with the end of a day and a day starts with the end of a night. But ultimately I will die one day. So is it that ultimately I just want to remain as happy as possible most of the times. That's the goal? You: Well, not a bad goal. Is it? I: There is so much imperfection in this world. Don't you think? So much unfairness, so much dirt. You: Yeah. I guess we are in this mess because everyone is confused. Everyone knows for a fact that he or she is alive, feels pain, doesn't want to feel pain, wants to be happy, wants to have things, can't have things because of others, then wants to hurt others. A whole dynamics of give and take in unfair ways. And it's good that our society is still progressing. I: Are we really progressing towards a better world? I was reading this book. She is a writer from the past century. But her imagination, her wording, her observation just mesmerized me. I probably have never talked with a woman in the world of today where I live who is as convincing, creative like the author I was reading. But you see.. I guess most people these days don't read or even write. Even I waste most of my time watching rubbish movies and videos than to explore my mind through reading or writing. It seems to me that all the advent of science and technology are making ourselves duller and duller, less of a human of some sort. We are losing more than we are supposed to gain as a human being. We are experiencing way less than our mind can truly conceive. You: May be you are right. I: I was also thinking that the society that we live in today doesn't really have an incentive system for doing good deeds. We have clear incentive to be successful, to be dominant, but do we really have incentive to be just good persons? I guess it's hard to establish such. Even though I have bad relationship with religion, I guess religion tried to exactly that- forcing people to do good with the fear of hell and God- that apparently doesn't work. But in a world of today, does anyone want to be a good person anymore? What does it even mean by goodness? You: These are hard questions. I wish I had answers. May be nobody has. You and I – 1 : https://experienceandembrace.wordpress.com/2019/01/23/you-and-i/ You and I – 2 : https://experienceandembrace.wordpress.com/2019/01/27/you-and-i-2/ You and I - 3: https://experienceandembrace.wordpress.com/2019/01/29/you-and-i-3/

Title: Humanism and Veganism

Content:
To conclude "Humanism and Veganism should go hand in hand". Do you agree? If you do, then good bye. Go use your time in more productive way, even though it won't be a waste of time reading. Fellow vegan here. I totally agree with this person raising his voice to explain because I have the same sentiment. Lots of Vegans(don't know the correct estimate) are out there just for a lifestyle choice, weight loss, fashion, trends, vegan communities for fun and connectedness. Unfortunately, when their knowledge of animal cruelty is mostly derived from some good speakers like Ed, whereas they are completely ignorant about politics and human injustice. Just like you can not be non-vegan environmentalist, I think you can not be a non-humanist Vegan. But the plethora of non-humanist Vegan just surprises me. According to Ed's argument, people who have been raised Vegan are automatically or naturally be compassionate to other human beings. I think there might be a high correlation there. But not exactly true for many vegans. It might be that most Vegans are converted Vegans and their having no sympathy for fellow human beings come from their experience with other human beings. It will be hard to quantitatively measure the difference between raised and converted Vegans exactly now, with the few numbers of Vegans who have been raised by Vegan parents. Unfortunately, I have negative data points for raised Vegan as I see quite a bit of correlation with someone's religiosity. Being from the Indian subcontinent, I have few Jain friends who are close to Vegan in terms of their food choice, who have been raised as Vegan with the same ideas of compassion and restriction. However, unfortunately, many of them eat animals now whenever they can by hiding from their parents, and have no issue with using animal products. They just fall in love with the taste of animals like anybody else as they have done it for the first time, and unfortunately, they put their taste bud pleasure above the pain of an animal. You can argue that their Jainism/Veganism are not well thought out, rather imposed by their parents just like somebody's religion is imposed upon them. But then it becomes a circular argument and ultimately comes back to my conclusion. I have seen many Vegans who hate other human beings, are lousy in terms of other moral aspects, other important things in the world. If you ask the question to a Vegan "If you have to save a human versus an animal, who will you save?", a lot of them will pause to take a choice. There should not be any pause to answer that question, it should be clearly human. Human life is more precious than animal life. There's a clear moral hierarchy. We need to understand that there is no absolute morality, only relative morality which will be ever progressing with time. So, ultimately what I mean, a huge number of Vegans don't really care about human rights, the oppression towards human being happening right in front of their eyes, mass incarceration, social inequality, wealth inequality, warmongering. I would even argue there's a fair number of Vegans who are Trump supporters and they don't really care about how political actions might make other humans suffer all across the world. But I do believe if there were a political activist Ed or group of Eds standing in the street corner showing people the truth, they would change their mind. A Vegan is more likely to change his mind, I want to believe. But to my dismay, very few Vegans would like to do that, and there is where I feel for this brother. I do think, if there were an Earthling Ed for each of the topics of human rights, if there were a group of individuals standing on the street for talking and trying to convince other people for each of the areas of social injustice, you can always sway people's opinion to the more compassionate path. The fact that you are only gathering together only for animal rights; and it is hard to see a group of white men and women standing together talking about the right of black American, Mexicans, it shows a clear bias. What's your stance on illegal immigrants? Do you want to make them suffer whereas you stand for the rights of animals? What do you think about wealth inequality? What do you think about other religion? What do you think about wars and children dying in the wars? And of course animal rights? I think you should think about all of them. I know our time is limited. Maybe we will not be able to involve ourselves in all of them, but at least we should be impartial in our knowledge of them. Every Vegan should have the compassionate, moral, rational answer for each of these questions. For me, these are not mutually exclusive. And I think Ed has the same moral take on it (at least that's what I understood watching his many videos), but I don't know how his energy is distributed. So, I totally understand this person and the people in the group. Do you understand him and me? You have chosen to fight for animal rights. But ask yourself? Why haven't you chosen to fight for criminal injustice, child labor, institutional racism, wars? Is it because it's easy to join your local vegan group and hang out and do vegan feasts with your jackfruit barbecues? It's fine to do so, but how impartial are you? If you are the one, who puts his energy into all these other activists, I respect you, and my criticism is not for you. But if you are not, then firstly I congratulate you for choosing the Vegan path, let's grab that vegan sandwich together, lol, but then I will probably convince you to stand in the street some other day for other reasons. Make sense Vegan fellas! And as you can see in the video, in the end a true humanist and a true Vegan are gonna hug it out. 🤗😀🤭 Read more : https://thehumanist.com/commentary/why-vegan-priorities-are-humanist-priorities #vegana #veganuary #veganismo #veganbodybuilding #veganpower #veganfitness #vegandish #vegandishbook #vegansofig #veganweightloss #veganism #veganeats #veganbeauty #vegandinner #food #foodporn #veganbodybuilding #veganbodybuildingfoods #powerofnow #spiritual #spiritualawakening #running #nature

https://youtu.be/EAmmUIEsN9A This kid is telling us, adults with brains, about climate change because we apparently forgot how to think and shut our eyes to see ! And then when I listen to those adults denying climate change, my jaw drops; specially those big fat ones in the parliaments of various countries, from even specifically including the self-proclaimed world police withdrawing from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Most parents are raising their kids; most adults are basically hating their jobs, in coming days probably won't even find jobs; some adults are trying to invent every form of entertainment so that they can escape the reality - it seems like everybody already deluded each other believing that we are going to live in the same world that we were born somehow. We are living in the fourth but the biggest technological revolution- the internet, the social media, the money revolution, the artificial intelligence, mars exploration in one hand, on the other hand the decimation and destruction of our own planet and atmosphere by our own greed. Parents have no idea that the schools, colleges they send their kids probably won't help their kids find any jobs as the way Google, Amazon are developing Artificial Intelligence and the automation is taking away jobs from human hands and our schools have no clue about future but to teach the same books they taught our grandparents, and then on our lands on which we build our homes, probably the most habitable lands, will no longer be available in most areas due to natural hazards resulted by climate change. Countries are still trying to steal oil from each other, fossil fuel industries are still lobbying so that they can make some extra dollars by going against green renewable alternatives, rainforests are being destroyed so that the overpopulated earth can eat more and more; but then when the cyclones and tsunamis will rise from the ocean, when the earthquakes will just decimate acres of lands, displace millions of people and force them to migrate and cause wars and battles as our vague nationalism and capitalistic self-cyclic greed are just making us more selfish and self-righteous and less compassionate day by day; when the melted ice and glaciers and the consequent sea level will just level everything within few decades; I don't know where will all these entertainment politics and mudslinging and worrying about the smallest little things, fighting over the silliest topic on the outdated television channels will go. To be pessimistic, may be, the nature will just blow up the earth with all our interesting circus inside; just like a cruel boy uses his cruel lazy feet to destroy an ant colony that those small, little, hard working ants have built little by little, after sweating for days and nights. To be optimistic, I guess, we will have like some child genius activist like this school kid who will motivate all of us to do the right thing, to take the actions necessary, to start loving our planet, to enjoy living together peacefully with all the other species. I don't want to live with horrors, rather I want to live in a world full of optimism and energy and with the sense that I am working towards making the world better than the world I was born. I was not aware before because I didn't have the information, I didn't know how our world is shaping into a nightmare because of climate change. This little kid talks about how she doesn't want to be a climate scientist to discover another issues for the future that will not exist because of what we are doing now and now and now. We can change and we will have to change. She shows how we can change, how we can take actions to save our mother earth for our own selves. And it starts by understanding what we have done wrong, and how we can do right- like may be, we should reduce burning fossil fuels, may be we should not elect politicians who are ignorant about climate change, artificial intelligence, may we should start using electric cars to try to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide, may be we should start using renewable energy sources, so that the new renewable energy companies can florish, may be we should be vocal against industrial farming so that the greenlands, forests, rainforests don't get destroyed, may we should take care of our ecological niches, may be we should go vegetarian or vegan so that we consume less animal products, which will reduce industrial farming which is a significant cause behind greenhouse gas emission, may be we should rethink about other kind of jobs which can employ people who are dependent on the jobs that again are destructive towards our planet. We should live in the world of today and enjoy it in a way so that the world can florish. May be, we should learn to love our world. Please educate yourself about climate change.

I: I think I am full of superiority complex. I have this condescension and self-righteousness as I can see through. And why won't I? I feel disgusted when I can see the stupid self-destructive actions people take. Why are people so stupid? You: It's an illusion. You come from what you have experienced. You may know certain things more. But you don't know, can not know everything as you have not experienced everything. You only know your life and you see everything through your lens. You may be right in terms of what is to be done right, but you have no clue why they might not have been understanding what you understand. I: I hate to fail. You: It's ok if you fail now. Accept the failure. It does not mean "You are THE FAILURE". I: I hate deadlines. You: Deadlines are there so that you can enjoy the freedom afterward. Ultimately you are free and there is no rush. But don't you want to accomplish things in life? If you do, then deadlines are your friends. I: Is my physical experience that important? You: Your physical appearance, experience are important. Because your mind lives inside your physical body. I: Why am I so much bothered by the physical cravings - hunger for food, sex etc? They are killing me. You: They are your physical needs which need to be dealt with for your mind to keep engaged and flourish. Neglecting them, you will starve yourself and feeling starved your mind will not let you who you can truly become. I: Aren't physical appearances just the way to attract other people? You: Yes, but it depends on how you look. Our reality is that we already live in a society. You won't be who you are if your parents wouldn't raise you properly, if your closed ones wouldn't love and take care of you. However, attracting other people may not be the final goal of life. Therefore, if you are in a place where your physical appearance is harming your mental peace- like if you are fat and feel shame, you are creating a problem for your own self. There are things you can try to reconcile with. You need to think about your priorities - what you really care about. But you need to believe that you can change. You should be able to hope. You are more than your body and your mind. So say when you feel vulnerable "I am not just my body. I am not just my mind either." I: What do you think about minimalistic life- making everything simple, possessing few things? You: It might help you stay away from debt or pay off your debt. Letting redundant things go can save yourself from taking unnecessary burdens Depending on how you do it, it can be adventurous. You can be a digital nomad or an urban nomad. You can travel around, make more friends and have some exciting experiences. But you need to be brave and be ready to be surprised constantly and be prepared for dangerous experiences too.

Startups grow, they flourish; they are like flowers, they need nourishment, they need support. Some grow and make the world beautiful, but many die while still showing the glimpse of new ideas. The entrepreneurship culture has the power to change the world and the ones who have already been recognized offer their shares to the public with their IPOs so that you can take part too. And as I am a Vegan trying to raise awareness about our environment, human and animal rights, I am so glad to see the success of "Beyond Meat" - they are a plant-based meat producing company. See their success (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/02/beyond-meat-plant-based-food-company-readies-ipo/). If you are not aware of the clean meat research and movement watch this video (How clean meat will change the food industry - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi5EfhPGHg4). The food industry tries to demonize clean/cultured meat by calling it "Fake", "Artificial", "Less masculine" etc. unfortunately, as if we live in an all natural world (Don't get your heart transplant because it's not natural right!!, don't use spectacles!! because God has given you the eyes you should be using.. don't have abortion even if it's unwanted pregnancy in the earliest stage.. cause embryos are as formed as real human babies.. so much incoherent bulshits ! Tired of the nonsense really!!!) Some IPO(Initial Public Offering)s to keep under your watch if you are into the stock market. For US residents, Robinhood(https://www.robinhood.com), the commission/feeless trading app, is great. In fact, Robinhood after acquiring 5 Million users, itself, is launching its IPO which is not listed in this link.

I am in San Francisco right now, just sitting in a Starbucks storming my brain about the recent happenings in my life. It's been about two weeks I moved to Bay area in California from Indiana. I waited for this for a long time and finally an internship at a tech company opened the opportunity to move from midwest to the west coast of America. And yes, the weather is different, warm as I  prefer. And a lot of things just simply changed. Or I should probably say that I have intentionally tried hard to make changes in the way I used to live before. I didn't seek for comfort this time, I seeked for adventures and unknowns and I am having it constantly. I no longer live in a house or an apartment. It was a challenging step to take. I actively wanted to explore the digital nomad life, partly with the intention of reducing the cost of living and partly to have some adventure in the territories of life unseen. And I have been successfully doing it so far. It wasn't easy, but as always, you learn on the way; by doing it, by failing, by getting hurt, but eventually succeeding, sometimes partially with some compromises. I required to buy a new car - a good car for camping. Sometimes I am staying in AirBnbs. Yesterday I stayed in a nice hotel, which was bit unexpected and had a funny story behind it. The inspiration to start a dynamic life came after watching few Youtubers and Redditers exploring the alternative way of living. It helps when you see others who have already done stuffs you have only been fantasizing to taste.  I got ideas from them about how to equip my car, how to roam around, how to take stops. Definitely the diversity and business of a city life help urban nomads to mesh their life with the days and nights of a diverse city and its various pockets. I have been exploring restaurants around, new bars, new latin dance events. I am trying to make new friends so that eventually if I stick to living here, I can have a fair amount of people I can give calls to hang out with. I am kind of rushing now, may be will go take a walk in the city. But hope to write more about different experiences.

"Economic rights are human rights. That is what I call Democratic Socialism. :)" Authoritarianism, and the self proclaimed kings and queens just make me seek. Why are we so selfish? What made us believe that we can just take advantage of the next standing man or woman for our own gains, but still somehow prosper in our own lives? May be these are the outcomes of unconscious capitalism and obsessive consumerism, subconsciously getting imprinted in our mind, making ourselves numb to the sufferings of our fellow brothers and sisters. Why is there lack of justice in the society, why is there so much manipulation, what's the impulse of being unfair and unjust? Is nature itself unjust, unfair, but does that mean we will have to be that way? There is only one brave man among the backboneless who can see it and say it how it is. And everyone else is just too busy wiping their own.. Time and time, we probably need to be remembered what it means by basic human rights, civil rights. Things we enjoy today didn't come easy! If there's only one thing I could change in education, I would change the history books more fun and factual for the generations to understand how we arrived where we are and why morality, fairness, empathy, cooperation matter for the survival and progress of the human animals.

Title: Programming as Art
Published Date: Fri, 05 Jul 2019 00:38:08 +0000

Content:
Programming is an art too. I got inspired to write this post after watching the video of the art making process of the artist below while writing or debugging a program. When I write a piece of code, I am creating a software. It is the creative process of building something that can be used by others or sometimes just only by you (like that mini calculator or tic tac toe or that stupid looking game) for your own hobbyist utility. An artist starts with an idea of what she wants to paint. A programmer also always has an idea of how the end product will look like. Then they both gradually work towards it, realizing limitations, bounds in time and space. Like an artist feels his or her limitation with canvas size, availability of color, complexity of shapes; a programmer realizes the bound in memory allocation in the finite RAM of the computer, speed of the operating system, disk space complexity etc. An artist needs to wipe out many parts of the canvas many times or improvise to ultimately produce what he or she really wants to project. A programmer needs to compile and debug many parts of his initially flawed program to fix each part, solve each mini problems to ultimately produce final working version. But for some reason, most programmers don't call themselves artists or feel like an artist. Is it a perception problem? Programming is perceived as a boring thing. May be the reason lies in the limited visualization power a programmer often has. What I mean is that, an artist can show his or her artwork to a lay-person and more often, people will get it with or without explanation. But it probably requires a lot of education, engineering, computational skills often to understand a program. In that sense, programming may be compared with craft too. But ultimately a program can be used, just like a hand craft can be put on your table to decorate or an art piece like a painting can be hanged on the wall. For example, I am using my keyboard to write on this text editing program of Facebook to write this post on "Programming as art". This small piece of editing program of the entire program that represents Facebook app or website is probably managed by a group of programmers/engineers at Facebook. They have written the program so that users like me can write their thoughts, ideas and post on their news feed as efficiently as possible; they can tag their friends, thay can put their location, they can add their feelings, they can add to their story, they can customize who can see their post. There are a lot of parts of this small piece of program (in fact it's not that small !). Facebook user like me who have experienced the evolution of this post publishing editorial program since the early age of facebook (like from 2005), knows how this program has changed over time, how it has transitioned into a master, multi-tasking programmatic art-piece. Now I have touched into another topic of creative process: Solo vs Collab effort. Instead of giving an example of a solo programmer writing his own little program (may be like when Zuckerberg was writing his first facebook code for liking/disliking photos back in the dormitory of Harvard), I have given an example of a collaborative effort towards creating a gigantic program (which is basically what programmers at software companies do). In that sense, it's like a big piece of sculpture or a building that artists are constructing, architects are planning and builders are setting up. I guess, the dynamics and complexity of a collaborative project is just a matter of scale. A single programmer or a solo artist doing the entire program or art, versus working in a part of a collaborative big art, programmatic, software projects. There is a book named "The art of computer programming" by Donald Knuth (https://www.amazon.com/Art-Computer-Programming-Fascicle-Millennium-ebook/dp/B00RN14FNC). Now in the end, what I personally think that, any human endeavor can be turned into something artistic. Like cooking, dancing, writing. Who is an artist? Are you an artist? Is science entirely separate from art? I don't think so. The scientific process can be artistic. Math is also regarded as art. What makes the distinction between art and non-art? I personally need to think and explore more into this question. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl3eMYWCdrw&feature=share

Beside the flowing Mississippi The sounds of cricket The warm sunlight My sweaty red T-shirt The gentle soothing wind My dirty white shoes The "zhikzhik zhikzhik" sound of the rail truck The hooshing sound from the passing cars Above the bridge The dock with empty white boats The two speedboats One with a girl and one with a boy The girl jumping on the other boat and their speedy departure The green leaves This not so clean footpath This big pyramidlike modern architecture on one side And this old unmanaged bushes on the other side The memory with my screaming with my mom in the morning The feeling of unfulfillment in my gut The despair and the long breathing in my heart My unresolved love with my ex This messy bushes reminding me the desire to live But the constant struggle with the fear of being not enough The simultaneous desire to live and decease The desire to leave the ego behind The desire to fly away from the horrors in my mind And the cheroky Indian girl from last night And her naked body with a pair of glasses in her shy eyes The lonely left out bird And the black lamppost And the lady collecting whatsoever from the river All the mess And this walking And this losing And this desire to be loved. #poem #travel

Title: My Letters to a friend for "Why Bernie Sanders", "Why against Trump and centrist Democratic candidates (including Elizabeth Warren!!!)"

I had this informal email conversation on democratic primary elections and candidates that I am feeling to share with my readers. Hope it helps for the right cause that I believe in. Hi Carolyn, Glad to hear back from you. I left California and moved back to Indiana to finish my degree. I may be back next year and if I do, I would like very much to hang out with you guys, playing frisbee and stuff. My position that "Only a progressive can win against Trump"- you are right on that. And I will emphasize that again. A centrist, corrupt establishment tactics won't work against the radical right, "will do anything, any crime no matter what to win" Trump base and right wing politicians. To defeat corrupt, evil Trump, you need the honest, truthful, street fighter like Bernie. Don't trust polls, polls reflect what the total population of the country think at a time. Election doesn't happen that way.. election happens state by state.. gradually increasing the momentum of the winner. So, basically democratic candidates who can not win the early swing states, will not win against Trump. And also, democratic candidate who does not appeal to a portion of Trump voters, black, latin, diverse voters, can not win against Trump. Candidate who can not energize people with their rhetoric to get out and really vote (specially the young people) will not win against Trump. Warren's base is highly educated white population (like I guess you and many Californian democrats!). So, based on this ideas that I said, I firmly think only Bernie can win. I also think Yang is a good candidate who is now 4th and has real solution. But I am doubtful about Warren (and Yang, because he may not attract establishment democrats) because of her centrist policy, "will get along with the establishment, play along" strategy, because of her lies of being a native american (Pocahontas!) while getting into Harvard, because of her weak foreign policy (she just voted for Trump's military budget), because of her taking money from corporations, pacs during general election and also channeling her corporate senate stage money now in the primary while claiming she is only running a grassroot movement like Bernie etc. Also the identity politics (vote because she will be the first woman!!) is not gonna hold either this time. But of course Warren will make a good president (way better than everybody else but Bernie) but she will ultimately be someone like Obama who wanted to do a lot of good things. And this country needs more, because it's literally bleeding. And you truly need changes like FDR brought to this country to fight back the extreme inequality and extreme corporatist culture. I would highly recommend to watch this video on Warren: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkzRURcRbkY Anyway. My frustration is.. I am not a US citizen and I am not gonna vote. I hate Trump, I dislike warren because of their foreign policies. My interest in US politics come mainly from two standpoints- foreign policy and climate change. US is powerful and if they can't fix their own democracy and if they can't change their policy and strategies to fix climate crisis, this world is screwed. And that's why I care to have a US president who understands and have humanistic values and against corporate greed. And this shift is needed all across the globe. Look what happened in UK, Boris Johnson, turned into UK prime minister, now pushing for Brexit. I am pretty sure.. it's happened because of the rise of Trump. This right wing monstrous rise across the globe need to stop. Again.. my frustration is.. most americans are not educated enough on most of the policies and details of what's going on domestically and internationally. And that's why they elect someone like Trump! Because Americans vote someone based on whether they personally like them or not!!! riddiculous. Have great days. See you. :) Andy. ------------------ On Mon, Sep 9, 2019 at 7:25 PM Carolyn Ray wrote: Hi, Andy. Your position that only a progressive can win against Trump is unusual. We shall see. I hope that a progressive *can* win, but I'm not convinced yet. Eric and I were just looking at the polls showing that 46% of the country still approves of Trump, and asking each other, "Who ARE these people!?" We are stepping up our efforts to get democrats to vote. I'm also not sure how much a person's debating skills matter; not that many people watch the debates. But I do agree that Biden isn't great at expressing himself at this point; maybe he's slipping in his old age. Have you left town already? I thought I might see you again at frisbee and lunch to continue discussions... ------------------ On Sat, Aug 3, 2019 at 12:19 PM Hey Carolyn, Thanks for your email. Yes, you are right. Warren specifically is not taking large sum of money from corporations. My criticism was not specifically directed towards Warren. It was more towards Pete and others. And also you will have to look not just the campaign money, rather their previous links and associations. I don't have much against Warren. I would like her to be even president. In fact, I want Bernie/Warren or Warren/Bernie together as president and VP. I don't think anyone but a progressive (Bernie/Warren) can win against Trump, given that ultimately democrats will have to win midwest swing states like Obama/Biden won in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election#Results_by_state). For the same reason, established democrats think Biden may win.. but Biden can not because he is super bad at debates and he has multitude of issues with african americans, trade related issues etc. And I don't think Warren can win there either. So, ultimately it seems to me only Bernie has the capability to win there and ultimately overturn Trump. Watch this recent video too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlWJEttS5s4 Thank you. Andy. Another thing I want to add.. the biggest critique against Warren is that "both Tulsi & Bernie have (opposed) every military budget increase while Warren has (supported) it every time". Warren will be as bad as Hillary Clinton in terms of foreign policies. But she will be as good as Bernie in terms of domestic policies. So, ultimately, who was right suited for every aspect.. comes down to Bernie. The only issue is his age and I think Tulsi can make a great VP. Anyway, I am a progressive and I do think only progressives can win against Trump.. no corporate dems like Harris, Pete and Biden have any freaking chance.. where US is right now. Thanks. Andy. Just saw this donor related video https://youtu.be/cmVFNc6ZT70 But being said that, I think Warren can change. But as you know, past always haunts.. https://nationalinterest.org/feature/elizabeth-warren-moves-left%E2%80%94-foreign-policy-40617 --------------------------- On Fri, 2 Aug 2019, 11:35 Carolyn Ray, <carolyn@supersaturated.com> wrote: Hi, Andy. After we talked about this at lunch post-ultimate-frisbee, I looked at the OpenSecrets site myself. It's why I asked where you were getting your information about these candidates' donors. Then you sent me the link to the web site that seemed to contradict what you'd said. There must be something I'm missing. I thought you said something about Harris and Warren being beholden to big corporations or oil or something like that. -- Carolyn Ray, Ph.D.

I enjoyed making this video. I love poetry. Hope you will enjoy my reading from "Leaves of Grass" by Walt Whitman. I have been reading poetry under the sunlight after the first snowfall in West Lafayette. The book I am reading now is called "Leaves of Grass" by the famous poet Walt Whitman. I am reading from Autumn Rivulets in the book. The first poem is "To a Foil'd European Revolutionaire", the second is "This Compost" and the third is the last few passages of "Song of Prudence". “Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash.” And I never miss the chance of using this quote of Leonard Cohen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBo-i3WdIUA

"They say we are a divided nation and he kind of rejects that narrative. We are all in this together. Not me, Us - is what he believes." I am sitting here in the coffeeshop working, and I can hear the name "Bernie Sanders" from my surroundings from real human being again and again but unfortunately, you will never hear that name in television channel and main stream media! After watching the debate last night, I felt like there was only one wise man/woman on the debate stage, who does not want to win just for the sake of winning, who speaks the truth no matter what, who doesn't want wars, but importantly, who really cares about people and who really wants to bring justice and fairness and improvement in the health and mind of the people and this country. This is all Bernie said yesterday, so you can judge yourself if you haven't heard. Two important things to think about "1. Who can win against Trump by winning the swing states if Trump is still there? 2. Who can change the system through domestic and foreign policy so that people from home and abroad won't have to worry about their health, education, children and then the world because of the climate change and regime change? " And people who are supporting Buttigieg, are you guys nuts? He has 0% african american vote, what world are you living? The last democratic president was Barack Obama and he won by winning the african american votes, the same is true for Bill Clinton. Your intelligence really surprises me for many different reasons! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4FAVae-ZXQ

I am little heart broken last two days. And I guess like many of you, I go back to those songs we can relate. I was watching the movie "Eat, Pray, Love". It was enjoyable to watch, but at the same time I despised it as I read the book first. One line I love from the book that I loved seeing two characters play on the screen though. It goes like this "“Sometimes to lose balance for love, is part of living a balanced life.”" I have been trying to be productive in the morning. But then got hooked with this Japanese song.

Title: Where do you get your protein?

Where do you get your protein as a vegan/vegeterian if you are not eating meat? The most common question I get, even from my BS, BEng, PhD, MD and MBA friends who have studied books after books their entire life and knows how to google the most rare information out of internet..!! Answer: We get protein from the best natural source, actually we get the protein where the cows and chickens get their protein from. This is how it goes.. the flow of protein to your body. Cows, chickens eat grains etc. ---> Protein converts into amino acid --> Muscles are built from the amino acid in the body of the cow, chicken etc. ---> You murder yourself in the name of God or whatsoever or be part of the cruel process starting from the butchershop/farms to the grocery store to acquire meat etc..!! ---> You then cook and eat cow, chicken etc. or buy food in the restaurant ---> You get protein. Feel glad that it took these many years to know how you get your muscles and muscular energy!!!!>>>>????? "In a cow's diet, protein comes from crops like soybeans and the seed of cotton plants.." Conclusion: You eat meat because you like to eat meat, you have been indoctrinated, addicted to meat. It's deeply cultural, it's deeply inside our habits and rituals. And it's very hard to unhook yourself. May be you also don't know much about nutrition. However, most vegans/vegeterians are vegans not because they care about their own health, they care not to kill something that contains life and can have an eye contact with you and feel fear and cry in pain. Yes, you are selfish when you eat meat, because you think you are at the top of the food chain, because you compare yourself with a lion or a tiger who would kill you if they would get you in the wild and so many other vague arguments without acknowledging that you are evolved to be a rational, moral human being who can criticize his or her own action if necessary. May be you haven't thought about your own cruelty towards living beings, just like the war mongers don't actively think about the suffering of hundreds of human beings when they shoot a bomb or launch a missile, but you are part of it everyday, but you don't have to be. So, yes, human being are cruel, there's a fight for dominance, you need to be strong and strong survives, but I hope we can change the world from such a scary hierarchical society to a much more co-operative society where love and compassion are harnessed. So, we are talking about change here, we are thinking about moral and ethical evolution as vegans. It's not just about stop eating meat and end of story. Sorry, many vegans also don't understand and vouch many non-convincing reasons. Also, importantly, just being a vegan doesn't automatically make you a better human being, you can be shittiest person in many things that matter and you should be thinking of. Anyway, You can live healthy, happy and as energetic, as mascular by not being part of killing an animal. You also don't have to bring God again to justify your superiority.. And I do understand how much you love the taste of meat, I hope we will have to wait another 10 years to get cultured artificial meat, so that you can be satisfied. Is cell-cultured meat ready for the mainstream? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYXw_-vJFBA What's the function of carbohydrate, protein and fat really? Carbs: Broken down into glucose, used to supply energy to cells. Extra is stored in the liver. Protein: Broken down into amino acids, used to build muscle and to make other proteins that are essential for the body to function. Fat: Broken down into fatty acids to make cell linings and hormones. Extra is stored in fat cells Vitamin: Veggies etc. Yes, someday, vegan food makes me feel tired. Because we consume less calory in general, which keeps our weight checked. But it mostly happens, when I am not planning my meals/foods properly, or eating unhealthy. You can eat unhealthy either as a vegan or meat-eater. I can just live on potato chips and stay vegan which is in no way healthy, just like someone can eat McDonalds burger and fast food and grizzy meat everyday. So, being vegan also forces you to think about your meal and nutrition in it. It's not radical to not kill something that feels pain. You must have to be radical to believe that vegans/vegetarians are radicals to express their concern towards our immoral acts for centuries, towards our indirect or direct cruelty possibly three times a day. We understand that forcing morality onto someone, making someone do something forcibly is also moral. So, we try to speak up with the hope that you will probably understand and one day will take that step to do the right thing and we will progress one inch to a world where there's one more compassionate human being. How to build muscles on vegan diet: And yes, I am using strong words, to make you think ;), as the rap God Eminem said, "People will hate you for speaking the truth, but you've gotta learn to stand up to them, so don't be offended if I say something you don't like."

Title: I miss you

I miss you. But there's a part of my mind fights back saying "Why should I?" But I genuinely miss you. I miss those afternoons when I would go walk through the aisles of the grocery stores and you telling me the things to put in the shopping carts. I miss those mornings going out running leaving you in bed and thinking that you will be waiting for me and fantasizing about some sweaty sexy moments. I miss driving miles after miles feeling exhausted in one end, but feeling exalted with the thought that someone is cooking for me. I miss walking down the streets after watching shows in some theater halls.  I miss getting annoyed by you when you would make me walk through all the stores in the shopping mall. I miss staying up late all night watching silly stuff. I miss writing poetry for you. I miss you planning for our trips. I miss you being mad at me. I miss waking up and seeing your face. I miss ruminating your smile. I miss planning for our future. I feel sad that nothing of us except the memories really exist. But as you said life is and should be like this.. for long I just wanted to hold onto. As they say life is like being a shore and experiencing the sunny and stormy days. I wish I could get back my sunny insignificant days. But I feel tormented when I realize I can not go back in time. I hope to have some in future but I feel exhausted because nothing feels like as it used to. But I still hope that I will probably wake up feeling new again and can forgive and can remain calm and poised forever thereafter. I miss you. I feel to talk to you. But I know I should not complicate more. I know I can not build up expectations anymore. I went through those stages of denial, anger, bargain. I am still in the stage of depression that feels like forever. I want to believe that I accepted what felt to be betrayal. I know I can not explain you why it couldn't be easier. I know I messed up, I know it's probably me who wasn't enough. It was unbelievably unfathomable to not want you the way I used to. I know why you had to leave, I know why I had to stay away. In many ways, that's probably what should have happened with the things that we started to want from our lives. I am happy that you now have so many experiences that may be you would never have otherwise. But it hurts to think that I would never be able to know how it would feel like if we were still waking up together. I accept that every end is a new beginning, but the heart still hurts to accept the end that was never desirable. But it ended. But I do really miss you. There are many questions you will never be able to answer me honestly, because you will have to protect yourself, justify yourself. And I understand that and may be same go with me too. But I hope that we can both be happy in our separate paths.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpyrefzvTpI Yeah Leo.. you said in 2016 "Climate change is real and we need to work together collectively to save the world".. and years passing by, nothing is happening. Using paper straw and paper bag is not going to save the planet unless you vote the right kind of leaders who care! Nothing will happen until the leaders of the world can recognize how we need to move away from corporate profit motives to really figure out climate policies. You can not change anything when the President believes it to be a hoax and rolling back important environmental rules. Sad that half of this country don't really care whether many regions of this planet can exist another 100 years or so. Hope your God, whichever you choose to believe, will save the planet and your grandchildren and you continue making money by polluting the world now or just ignoring the facts and keeping your eyes closed, huh! Yes, economy is so great and unemployment is so much lower that people are sunbathing with joy!! 95 Environmental Rules Being Rolled Back Under Trump https://lnkd.in/en5aPM6 We will see massive security threats due to migration, starvation, deforestation and increased flooding, heat storms, intense earthquakes and cyclones and tsunamis. #climatechange

He is Rising.. On the other hand, they are full on using the Propaganda model 1. Undercutting his base of support 2. Missing his success in polls 3. Ignoring his endorsements 4. Saying America isn’t “ready” for his progressive policies 5. Highlighting the negative and going light on policy 6. Viewing him only with a socialist lens where as his socialism has nothing to do with the kind of socialism people are scared of. This honest and authentic man is 78. But he is still choosing to fight to save the country, save the planet. Every time I think of my age and he is like about 50 years older than me, I feel, shit, what am I doing? Every time I feel lazy, I feel like, where does Bernie get his energy to fight? Then I realize, ideals matter.. but more than that hoping for change and dreaming matters, having a purpose matters. Finding meaning in what you do matters. He has fought his entire life, still running in the trail... believing that this country, the world can change for the good. He is fighting for better health for the people who are deprived, opportunity for education who lost hope, opportunity for housing who can't afford home, opposing the war mongering that cause many people on the other side hate America for years, saving the planet with a green new deal and reduce the horror of climate change. And most importantly, he is doing all these by not taking money from rich, greedy donors, he is fully empowered by the common people who want change. He gives me hope, he makes me believe- saying the right thing, being good and nice is still desirable. But more than anything, he teaches us to fight, fight for what you believe to be good for everybody. It's okay to be wrong, okay to fail, okay to be politically incorrect, okay to be crazy.. We are human, we can only hope and love and embrace beyond the fear and anxiety and hatred and all the negativities. https://www.salon.com/2019/12/30/the-bernie-blackout-appears-to-be-over-how-will-the-media-cover-the-sanders-campaign-now/

https://youtu.be/jNn3R6KVoc8 Well, well, well, 2020 starts with the signal of another war. It's a real game of thrones right in front of our eyes! US just killed the Iranian general that millions of people in that region revere as their hero and savior. It's almost like Cersei killing Ned Stark (from a muslim's perspective) in the north for Ned Stark being extremely dangerous to the throne. May be some may argue that the analogy is incorrect, but it depends on the perspective of which side you take. I probably don't need to explain who Cersei is here? And now Soleimani has two sons and two daughters who are probably going to grow up with hatred (what would you do if your father, the revered general of your country, was murdered on a drone strikes, swords are no longer used by the way!!), thousands of people in Iran and all across the world are ready to retaliate every opportunity they will get to take revenge on Americans and its troops, Iranian generals taking vows to revenge in the name of Islam. Americans abroad are being warned about their safety. Soleimani is not innocent either. No general of any active troops can be innocent, he was rather a calm poised man filled with contempt. In fact he is a mastermind of probably many wars and conflicts. Soleimani killed a lot of American soldiers during Iraq war just like, he kept many Islamic militia groups under his arms in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine etc. The war Hawks, war mongering republican people are saying( if you read comments on the Foxx news YouTube) that Soleimani has brought that onto himself. Well, it's their narrative. So, US just killed the second most powerful leader in Iran and probably started this with the strategy of changing the Khameini regime ( or do they even have a strategy? Is stopping war by killing another powerful general a strategy?? Seems like they believe it to be a good strategy- STOP KILLING by KILLING - nice!!.. who knows though..it's like bombing Hiroshima to stop world war.. world can be a strange place.. comes with great cost.. isn't it?). Soleimani used to always say that "He would be a martyr" one day and now the whole Islamic brotherhood has now one single chanting "Death to America" if you are following Iranian videos. Ah.. kill in the name of your God and religion.. sounds familiar!! God, I hate religion so much for this and only this reason only. I have been reading Fox news and every right leaning war hawk is cheering what a victory this is! these people's desire to go to war, thirst for blood and kill are just astounding to me. I almost lose faith in humanity. I mean, power struggle is hard and probably without conflict, it's hard to change the world. But the history of killing each other is just so demoralizing, we have been doing these for thousands of years, this is so depressing. A huge can of worms might have been opened. US is definitely the super power and no other country has the power to win an all out war at this point, but do US war Hawks really want bloody wars again when they complain so much about deficits and debts? Do they not think about far future when they may not have as much strength as they do now? Did history teach nothing? The US officials say "If we are attacked, we will retaliate too." I mean is this the world the world leaders want to create "threatening each other and killing each other's generals"? Anyway, they just made all the snakes to crawl into the den of the lion that US claims it to be. And there will be a lot of poisonous bites over decades here and there. People who read the history of wars in past couple decade really don't need to watch Game of thrones or any fictions any more! The world is more fictitious and poisonous! This is horrible, anybody has any bit of knowledge of foreign diplomacy knows how backward going this is! This may probably trigger birth of many potential suicide terrorists and terrorist organizations again. I won't be surprised to see more suicide bombings in many US ally countries. Clinton and Obama had opportunity to attack Soleimani too, but they did not because of these sort of future consequences. Bernie Sanders opposed to Iraq and Afghanistan wars in the first place so that these sort of situations of revenge wars don't happen altogether. Republican presidents love fighting wars, don't they? US just sent 3500 US soldiers to middle East last night sensing Iranian retaliation, where as Trump promised that he will bring back soldiers!! And they will come back wounded.. oh wait, republicans don't have money for their health care now when they are back.. they don't care when veterans become homeless.. sorry guys, no free lunch is their narrative when it comes to health care and housing and education.. Perpetual war, war and war.. where the world is undergoing climate change and so many other big issues, when we should be gathering together to find technological and diplomatic solution to make this world a better place. We all know the power corrupts. History taught us many times why perpetual revenge taking never bring peace to the world. I am very afraid, if US foreign policy does not change, the world has really dark future. And my friends in US need to understand why it's important to elect President who understand the importance of peace and foreign diplomacy. Say "NO" to wars please. #war #foreign policy

Walking is no simple matter. A baby needs to learn to walk and a parent waits for more than a year for that single event. There's not many animals in animal kingdom who actually can walk (shifting weight from one leg to another and moving forward). It took millions of years of evolution to achieve this bipedal movement! Walking is not hopping like rabbits. It's interesting how these information are encoded in the DNA since our birth. It's stupid if you still believe in the sudden emergence of Adam and Eve who basically look like us by some supernatural almighty! All the scientific endeavors to understand our body, mind and preventative diseases to survive longer are based on our understanding of evolutionary biology. Evolution is a fact like gravity, well understood by scientists. But like gravity which can be demonstrated by a falling apple right in front of you, it's not easy to explain and understand evolution in such simplistic example. However, that is how any complex ideas are and you should make an effort to understand it instead of denying. I feel disgusted that biology teachers up until high schools and even univiersities tried religiously to deny evolution and not teach students the fundamentals of it. And look.. majority of even my PhD friends, with all their intelligence, deny evolution because that does not fit into their religious story. This is what happens when rather intelligent people become blind to certain things based on dogma. Well, I have no problem with religion as long as it stays in your personal prayer, but education policy or educational books (specially biology books) for an entire generation or for an entire population of a country should not be based on falsehood. Don't teach your kid that evolution is wrong please or when they ask you the question "Where did Adam or Eve come from?". Take yourself and them to some good museums! At least try to fit evolution in your religious story, for the sake of truth. If God really exists, he/she/it does not want you to lie to your kids! And also believing in evolution does not mean that we are now monkeys!!.. if that's what you understand or feel like, then you seriously need to read some more books on this topic. Just like you had to learn math, you need to learn evolution too! "Humans, birds and (occasionally) apes (gibbons) walk bipedally. Humans, birds, many lizards and (at their highest speeds) cockroaches run bipedally. Kangaroos, some rodents and many birds hop bipedally, and jerboas and crows use a skipping gait. This paper deals only with walking and running bipeds." https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1571302/

[gallery ids="2727,2726,2728,2729" type="square"] Bernie Sanders won by popular vote in IOWA.. and multiple evidences of cheating/bias against Bernie by Mayor Pete and other established democratic candidates are found(some may be innocuous and simply mistakes.. who knows!). With 97% precincts in, Sanders' lead over Pete Buttigieg with raw votes is over 2500, and Buttigieg is in virtual tie with Sanders 26.2 to 26.1, a margin of only 3 SDEs (State delegates). Still 100% results are not out and these results have many errors. Oh wait, CNN, MSNBC, and Pete Buttigieg himself called Pete to be winner. Oh wait, there's still 100% result not published. Oh wait, the published result has many errors. Oh wait, Bernie is still winning after everything against him. Oh wait.. this is awesome!! Oh wait.. people love Bernie, even in IOWA!! :) Bernie Sanders is predicted to win all the upcoming primaries with IOWA win tied with Pete Buttigieg in state delegates. 538 prediction for Bernie winning all other primaries except two. If you are into political betting..

This is why Bernie will win to bring real fair democracy back in America. Donate to send Vinay to canvas for Bernie. Biden is predicted to win in South Carolina. After Bernie's win in IOWA, New Hampshire and on.. and Biden's poor performance, hopefully South Carolina can be flipped. It all depends on volunteers like me, you and Vinay's effort to reach out to people and knock the doors. Pitch in. :) Let's change this country for better by getting Bernie up there. Bernie has a real path to do it this time after being unfairly played by Hillary in 2016. And Bernie will beat Trump. Many doubt that Bernie's socialist label (Bernie's democratic socialism is equivalent to capitalism by European/Scandinavian standards.. so don't fall for it) will dissuade many old moderate democrats and their ignorant kids to not vote for him (Rather they will vote for Trump!! What a shame!!), I say Bernie doesn't need those kind of democrats who will not vote a democratically nominated candidate in the general election, but rather vote Trump or not vote at all (however I do think it will be small percentage hoping all democratic candidates will be behind Bernie if he wins the democratic nomination). Bernie has Muslim votes, Hispanic votes, young generation votes, young to old African American votes, 4 years of 17 year old volunteers (from 2016-2020) who are eligible to vote, 18-44 year old votes who are not boomers(1944-1964) who don't care about how recent generations(Gen X(1965-1979), Millennial(1980-1994), Gen Y(1995-2015)) are suffering. If young people come out to vote who generally don't vote, Bernie will win with a land slide. Bernie may well not need those republican leaning Midwestern/Southern moderate democrats who love Biden (who secure 4th place in IOWA being called a front runner!!). Bernie can win. Progressives will win and end the mad Trump era in 4 years. Bernie, also has the card to put Elizabeth Warren as VP and get the Hillary democrats if needed. So, believe in Bernie's message "Not me, US." Let's make this country great, let's remove student debt, let's have green new deal to fight climate change and create jobs and the madness of fossil fuel industry, let's have Medicare4all and end the profiteering of drug companies and health insurance companies, let's not get into war with Iran, let's bring American troops back to stop regime change wars/proxy wars, let's bring some peaceful solution in Israel-Palestine situation, let's start negotiating with republicans from higher grounds/winning position... Let's do this.. This is a special year that we will all remember together. You can be part of this revolution. Get Some Rational National for food too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctasK3oslN4 Hello comrades, My name is Vinay. I am an immigrant student from India studying and working as a student intern at the University of Cincinnati. I've done my best to put America's dad in the white house. I phonebanked from India, before I ever came to America, for Bernie in 2016 and made 400 calls. When I came to Cincinnati in 2018, I was determined to fight for our progressive ideals in my community. So, I started the UC chapter of YDSA and fought against tuition hike on campus. I've also been tabling, canvassing, phonebanking, registering people to vote for Bernie this election cycle. We all know how important SC is for Bernie's momentum. That one win will upend all doubts of Bernie being the front runner. We need to win and win big enough to not even give any scope for rigging the convention against us. And I want to do as much as I can to help the movement. So today I ask you to sponsor my trip to Greenville, South Caroline for the weekend of Feb 14-16th. I am taking the car so it'll be cheaper, and staying at a modest hotel. And I've signed up for a total 9 hour canvassing shift over the weekend. I hope ya'll come through for your fellow berner. Solidarity forever! #feelthebern #bernie2020

I have started my Crypto cycle Twitch TV for monthly Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency update. Bitcoin has reached 10,000$ USD today. Last summer Bitcoin price has seen the high of ~13,500$ USD and then on, it was experiencing low price. Bitcoin has potential to break its last price ~20,000$ USD this year, because the money supply will be reduced in the summer of 2020. I think I can do better job making videos now on. The background audio volume should have been reduced. Coindesk news: https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-breaks-above-10000-in-spot-market https://www.twitch.tv/videos/549336880

"I was never going to go if I was waiting for someone to come with me" - Laura. It's time again soon for me to plan and move to a different city and I already started fearing a new life and missing my friends. And I have been reminiscing. Every time I move, I lose my friends and some of them are really close. It's hard to stay away from family too sometimes. It has been taking a great toll on me losing people from life, missing people and things I once cared and still care a lot. However, life really forces you to change a lot sometimes. But with every move, there are many surprising positive things that I eventually get, for example, new friends. Ultimately, it's the human relationship, which linger the most, whereas, some relationships get broken with many woes. I was reading few blog posts linked below on the merits/demerits of digital nomad life and just thought about my past. If I observe my life path, I have been a semi-nomad all my teen/adult life. This last 6 years (2014-2020) was probably the longest time I have lived in two adjacent cities for my graduate education in my '20s, but even in this scenario, I have changed apartments/house every year. First two years (2014-2015), I frequently visited my ex girlfriend in Urbana Champaign, then (2014-2016) I lived in Lafayette, whereas since 2017 up until 2020, I lived near Purdue campus in West Lafayette. And last summer (2019 May - 2019 Aug), I lived in Silicon valley and explored the central part of the west coast in California. But when I was in Japan (2008-2014), I lived in a city at most 3 years, 1 year(2008) in Tokyo, 3 years(2009-2012) in Shikoku, (2012-2014) in Osaka, 2014 in Tokyo again. Now, even if I look further back into my life in Bangladesh, I was born in Rangpur, Bangladesh, but then my parents moved in to Ulipur, Bangladesh (~1988 - 1994 ish) where both sides of my grandparents have our country homes, then my family moved to a slightly larger northern city Rangpur (where I was born) again and I studied 10 years (1994 - 2004) for my primary and junior level schooling. After that I moved to the capital Dhaka, Bangladesh by myself leaving my parents and had my high school there from (2004-2007) and started my college in 2008 for a semester right before leaving for Japan. And of course, even in these years from 1995-2007, I changed home almost every year. It seems to me, I have a true desire to move and roam. However, up until recently, I haven't really realized these facts of my own life very closely. Now that I can realize, I am questioning some of the future ideas that I have. Can I ever settle somewhere, with someone? Should I ? Will I? Sometimes I feel like I am incapable of settling down as I love the idea of fluid life. But I also don't want to have a set idea of life for mine either where everything is predictable. So, may be, it's better to just acknowledge that I just don't know about my future and I will never know concretely beyond just a map of ideas and dreams for an ever changing future yet to come. Last summer I didn't have a home and I constantly moved between airbnb, hotels, car camping. And I have been thinking whether I should go on full digital nomad mode. But as I can see there are many challenges of that. But have I ever feared challenges and risks? For me, I always craved adventures ! I believe I am not alone in this way of floating in the current of the web-like river of our lives in our society in each country on this planet in this universe. And I wish I could keep more snapshots of my life as one day it will end with all my memories inside my head. Gosh, I have so much yet to experience and embrace! I hope not to lose track of time. And I wish I could find the less to be more. #life #memories #travel #nomad #backpacker https://blog.tortugabackpacks.com/realities-digital-nomad-…/ https://abackpackerstale.com/ https://piktochart.com/…/unglamorous-facts-digital-nomad-l…/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX6NztnPU-4 "What is the point of it all?" It's kind of an ironic question, it's a foolish question. Herbert Fingarette (20 January 1921 – 2 November 2018) was an American philosopher and emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara who once argued that there was no reason to fear death. At 97, his own mortality began to haunt him, and he had to rethink everything. We have invented so many things like the big G, like those pursuit of happiness as nothing can fill the void this question creates. This is where the utility of belief in afterlife comes into action, because all of a sudden, if you believe in a rewarding or punishing after life, then a believer's meaning of life is to optimize his or her chance of getting reward instead of getting punishment. Suddenly life has a goal! What a great invention! What a great utility of fictions! But I guess we make a mistake when we connect these two notions: "(a) There's no point of life if I am eventually going to die" to ---> "(b) Then there's no point of doing anything to enjoy my moments and try to make my future moments". Yes, "You are going to die if you jump off that bridge". Yes, "you are going to lose your mind a bit after you finish that whiskey or do drugs". Yes, "you are going to piss off your mom or your friends if you become the same annoying and judgmental you are." So, the next moments do depend on what you do in this moment. Therefore, it is possible to ensure your next moments to be pleasurable or insufferable. But yet, if we look back, we realize we made most of our moments to be insufferable. We acknowledge most of it seem to be outside of our hands. But should that be the reason to give up, ay? And is striving to live life better and challenging your own self and realigning therefore the pursuit? Of course, there are many points in experiencing and creating our moments like getting that first job, falling in love, reminiscing that last goodbye, sending letters of love, protesting against injustice. But most of points are ultimately only valid for yourself, not for anyone or anything else. Only you can value your moment after all. You are the only judge of yourself after all. Death lets you identify the value of life. Life is the day and death is the night, in the long run. We are just a fly in the ocean of time and you only live in the NOW, not an waking moment before, not an waking moment later. But you can create a heaven or a hell with the way you think about your moments.

So, Bernie won. He won big in Nevada. "It's time to stop saying Moderates won't vote for Bernie." "People love Bernie and want him, not because of his ideology, not because of their own personal politics, but because people simply love honesty." Let's know more of what Bernie has done last 30 years. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYxZfksAyco "It's time to stop saying that Bernie can not beat Trump. He absolutely can. And he will do it by bringing the people who never voted before but whose lives depend on whether Trump stays or not." Love when the girl says in the video "He needs to know..We have been listening to him. We believe him and we support him." Now towards winning South Carolina and super Tuesday. But establishment will still throw everything towards Bernie to stop his nomination because for them it's beneficial to have another 4 years of Trump and get a corrupt democrat of their choice later, rather than have Bernie Sanders who will change the corrupt system inside out.

Bernie plummets to undisputed 1st place while Biden SURGES to distant second, nationally, finally! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiVRgEqnHVo If Bernie just can pull off South Carolina and knocks Biden out of the ring one more time! That's the hurdle and tomorrow's debate performance at Charlseton, SC is very crucial as every other candidate and media are ready to throw everything at him. Why is Jim Clyburn, the house majority whip from South Carolina, thinking about endorsing Biden after his miserable performance in IOWA, NH and NEVADA is beyond my common sense? Well! California, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania - Bernie is going to win. Michigan and Massachusetts are going to be tough race as they are the home states of Amy Klobucher and Elizabeth Warren. But Bernie can still pull that off given few more wins along the path. Marianne Williamson's endorsement after dropping out from the race is the biggest news of this week as she brings many people traditionally uninterested in politics early on now to understand Bernie's platform. May be because of her, Bernie may win Texas, even against Trump in general election. I hope Yang and Tulsi will support Bernie after super Tuesday. I like, one of the leading female anti-corruption activist, Zephyr Teachout(Attorney and Law professor) endorsing Bernie (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_Teachout). I actually like her more than Elizabeth Warren in terms of what she stands for. I wish she could run one day or get a significant position in Bernie's cabinet if she wins. She has the merit to be the first woman President of United States one day. And former African American senator Nina Turner as VP under Bernie will make it all-around. Indian origin Rep. Pramila Joyapal from Washington is endorsing Bernie and integrating her own proposal with Bernie's medicare4all to provide universal health care for everybody in USA. Indian origin California Rep. Rho Khanna from California and middle eastern origin Rep. Rashida Tlaib from Michigan and one and only AOC from NY are helping his message soar. The most multi-racial, multi-generational candidate of all time - Bernard Sanders. This country can truly boast of being united across gender and race and move forward with the green new deal and the real change which will propel the change in political dynamics all across the world. Bernie got the full house.. Game over! And yes, Bernie will beat Trump.. 100%. Landslide. If you don't remember, Trump didn't even win the popular vote last time, he was about 3 million votes behind Hillary Clinton. And Bernie will be millions and millions of votes ahead of Trump.. easily with all the young and multi-racial new voters who are always left out by centrist, establishment democrat.. now that most moderate democrats are also lining behind Bernie as evidenced in Nevada caucus. If you haven't understood Bernie's plan yet, it's time to realize and believe in him. Bernie did it when he became house rep in 1991 when nobody thought he could, he became the senator in 2007 when everybody was shocked, he defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 in multiple states and started the progressive movement when he had negligible name recognition compared to Clintons outside of the progressive circle and now in 2020 every other candidates are running on his platform with his original messages. And now to everybody's amazement again, he will win it. Anybody who still doesn't know what Bernie has done for this country for last ~40 years, I just really want to put a nail on your coffin.. sorry.. No, I am kidding. I love you and just learn more: https://www.sanders.senate.gov/legislation And if you are still complaining "How is he going to pay for everything?" I will just chime what my twitter friend Tina Parker says "How will we pay for it? Well, we pay for wars, bailing out Wall st, bankers, auto companies, etc.The price we pay for NOT having it: LIVES! These are parents, children, siblings. NOT ACCEPTABLE !!" https://twitter.com/Teeparker8/status/1232129067719307269… Because Bernie knows how to win. Because he wants to win not for himself, but for the ideals and changes this country and the world needs at this stage of history. Not Me, US. #NOTMEUS #bernie2020 #feelthebern

https://youtu.be/Pp9txWxQ8FM Bernie took a big hit in South Carolina (Biden ~49% vs Bernie ~20%, diff is ~29%). I will never understand the South ! Biden got 29 delegates and Bernie got 9 with 99% reporting. But to remember the Nevada result where the result was reversed ( Bernie ~49% vs Biden ~20%, diff is ~29%). Bernie got 24 delegates from Nevada, whereas Biden got 9 delegates. However, Bernie is the leader with 54 delegates (Biden:44, Pete: 44, Warren: 8, Amy:7) in the race of winning 1991 delegates to get the democratic nomination. And possibly, billionaire Bloomberg will get into the race of delegates strongly with all his money soon. You can't win them all. But the question is - Will Biden come back with moderate narrative after this big win? That's what rich donors and mainstream media and decent amount of old moderate democrats want. [facebook url="https://www.facebook.com/brishtiteveja/videos/10156795288051860/" /] Bernie is in advantage as super Tuesday is only 3 days away with +10% ahead in national poll aggregate on real clear politics. https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html However, most Bernie supporters expected much narrower loss of Bernie at South Carolina. This big win of Biden possibly have created a path for Biden, therefore for moderates, which will be determined in the performance in super Tuesday. Bernie is basically fighting against everyone- all moderates (Biden, Pete, Amy), two rich billionaire with unlimited sum of money (Bloomberg, Steyer) and even with his fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren. In some way, it comes to Bernie's advantage if the moderate votes get split among all moderates. But interestingly it's not that simple. Votes get crisscrossed quite a bit. People are irrational ! It seems like Bernie is even the second choice for Biden's supporters and Warren's supporters. Apparently, most people vote for the specific candidate more than their political ideology. So, is it again a 3 person's race among Bernie, Biden and Bloomberg? Will Warren over perform in some state and take Bernie's votes? Super Tuesday will answer it all. No matter how much Bernie supporters want to win everywhere, it's not going to come easy. It needs to be hard fought. And that is good. If the ultimate goal is to defeat Trump in general election, Bernie should pass every test. But I just wish, we all wish, if those test just are fair without foul plays. But, man, how much I love this 78 year old fighter who will fight for people's healthcare, education, climate and wars whereas everyone just is self-serving in thousand many ways. Sometimes I feel like this world really survives on few good people's shoulder. Thank you old man. You got the people power. Let's cheer your name to cheer you up. #bernie2020 #feelthebern [facebook url="https://www.facebook.com/brishtiteveja/videos/10156795295821860/" /]

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/opinion/bernie-sanders-campaign.amp.html I have been spending hours and hours thinking about the kind of world we live in. Most working class people didn't even have the minimum wage to live comfortably before this Corona virus, and now with this Corona virus, people lost even those jobs. We have about 10-20 million unemployed people only in US seeing the worst after the great depression, which will essentially just lead to violence and all forms of negative events you can imagine. And all happened in 2 months. But did it really happen just in 2 months? When we talked about booming economy, where did all those booming money go really? As far as I know they didn't go to people's hand to support them in this worst nightmare. The same is happening in any other country. I feel sad that things will probably not change for another decade for people who really needed change. I look at the headlines after Bernie dropped out and I feel sick. Because real monsters and real selfish psychopaths run this country and the world. I feel like blaming people for being stupid and selfish, but then I realize if you raise children in bad circumstance, if you suffocate people in bad economy, bad environment, good people will turn into evil. So, who to blame really, it turns out to be those few rich powerful people, party or corporation who will not let things change for the majority of people. But may be, even they don't know what to do, because they are just trying to keep their status quo. We live in such a hierarchical society, such a class based, status based society where our well-being are and will be constantly crashed. But as I read enough history of mankind and animal kingdom, this was always the case because the Red queen hypothesis of evolution suggest that any individual or community need to constantly adapt, change and learn to play better as they will constantly be pitted against competing individuals or species. This literally makes us just animals constantly trying to push each other and survive. I mean, as humans we will probably never understand the meaning of humanity. Being right does not make you win. But then if you don't win, is that a failure? I hope not. May be when you try to be right, you already sacrifice many things. Some people will die but then will never die in our memories for their selflessness. But then some people will drink your blood as long as they live and are around you and will feed off of other people's sufferings. I don't know what to make of the world. I guess you can still be happy inside your bubble, you can arm guard and party inside your villas, palaces letting people die outside your fences. The world does not make me feel good. But may be this is how it always was. But that's why we dream to change. But may be that change for a good fair society I won't be able to see in my lifetime. But I hope changes will still take place little by little. I still try to be optimistic, because otherwise there's no meaning of living really. Hope we will learn something to make it not this much worse next time. So, my heart is heavy with aches. And these are just not feelings, these are caused by real tangible death and sufferings of millions of people. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/opinion/bernie-sanders-campaign.amp.html

You can only become something if you want to become something strongly putting aside the luck factor. Think about how a sportsman like a soccer player, basketball player, or a musician or an actor or a doctor or an engineer become successful. They learn, they work hard for years after years to gain skills. Same apply to business and money, it's a skill to earn money and grow money via creating business, investing and many other means. However, lot of the professionals who work under somebody, who don't take direct monetary responsibilities don't know or avoid to know the ways to grow their money, because generally people are risk averse. For some reason, many people have negative mental association with money, may be it's because most people with money are powerful and we see them abusing their power in our society. But at the same time, we need to acknowledge that if we want to do meaningful things, we need to understand the process of making money and channeling them to the right direction. To stay sane in the path of money making in an honest and meaningful way, I believe we need a purpose like creating service, company to provide or create employment or innovate etc. Also, you succeed by failing many times, so resilience is key. Are most successful people money driven or purpose driven? I guess both can take you to riches, but may be the later is better. Let's find purpose to stay motivated and work hard. Let's strive to change and create. And money and success should follow. https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/288452

Title: 100,000 $$$ = 1 Bitcoin (Year 2040)
Published Date: Sat, 18 Apr 2020 15:15:11 +0000

May be, 100,000$ per Bitcoin by the year 2040. So, are you owning/holding/trading/investing in Bitcoin for next 20 years? This is the bullish case. Different projections for Bitcoin price to go up to 100,000$ possibly by 2040. In the year 2017, we saw the last all time high (~20,000$). In 2019, we had another peak (~15,000). Due to Corona virus and current economic depression, we will possibly not see great growth until the recession starts to recover. However, all the peaks since the birth of Bitcoin is above the Bitcoin growth curve (yellow line that acts as the supporting base). The thin white lines are Bitcoin logarithmic growth curves which shows exponential growth of Bitcoin price leading to 1 million dollar by that time! However, that is overly optimistic. Bitcoin price is most likely follow the growth patterns shown with the green, red and purple lines. Those lines will reach 100,000$ mark in the year of 2031, 2035, 2038 respectively. And who knows, Bitcoin even can reach a 1 million dollar mark!! These lines may act as support and resistance many many times while keeping the same growth rate over a longer timeframe. This is speculation to persuade new Bitcoin users. Bitcoin only gains as long as it's more used, owned and invested, just like any other assets. The only difference in the case of Bitcoin is that, the growth rate will be much faster as Bitcoin, being decentralized cryptocoin and with a finite supply and with the security provided by the proof of work, is less likely to be manipulated by any entity. So, what's the bearish case. On the other hand, if people start disbelieving in Bitcoin, or people lose a lot of money because Bitcoin's security get compromised (unlikely!), or all the governments of all the countries decide to stop internet to block Bitcoin (unlikely!), or ban cryptocurrency exchanges or make them illegal like in some countries (likely!), or jail many many people for owning Bitcoin via fear mongering (unlikely!), or some other reasons for why speculators may lose interest, or some other crypto currency will reign over Bitcoin, Bitcoin price will not go as high as mentioned above(unlikely!). But, I believe it will still remain valuable (will stay above around the yellow line, maintaining around 20K price). Bitcoin will find itself in human history for a great experiment, no matter what. But, why not taking the bet? I am accumulating as many as possible. But when you invest, but we should also learn to diversify portfolio to spread the risk. Let's say you have 1000 dollar, then put 50$ (5% of 1000$) at least in Bitcoin, and then the rest you can put in valuable company stocks, real estates or whatever else is your favorite. I'm more inclined to put more! Let's be the rational bitcoiner. There is only 21 million bitcoin, if you own 1 bitcoin you will get into the 21 million bitcoiner club, if you own 21 bitcoin you will get into the 1 million bitcoiner club. #bitcoin #blockchain

So, I thought to make a list. Sometimes making a living or earning online while traveling is just about knowing where to look for information or growing opportunity. Also you need to grow your own reliable network so that you eventually have a stream of job options. It's not easy, it's pretty challenging but it can be adventurous. Sometimes just having a laptop or even a smart phone and some dedicated time with your awesome brain, it's possible to earn money.

Nature doesn't show any mercy, as if Corona virus was not enough! And it takes away home and food from those who were already about to go homeless and starved. :( When scientists talk about climate change, this is what they mean, the sea level is rising which makes low lying areas like my country Bangladesh very vulnerable as the devastation of storms and other natural disasters will affect manyfold, much harder. Just praying and donating few dollars to charity are not gonna convince God to show mercy if we continue disrupting nature. We need to reduce the use of fossil fuels in many ways and protect our environments through government policies and follow the guidelines climate scientists propose. We also need many non-government initiatives too. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/climate-change-supercharging-extreme-events-12753090 "In Bangladesh, hundreds of villages are underwater and about 1 million people don’t have electricity anymore. And in the southwestern district of Bagerhat, about 500 fish farms were flooded." #disaster

Title: There's a way she looks you can't ignore

I met a girl not so long ago. I still remember the first time she talked to me with full of enthusiasm. And then the few moments I was with her, she curved a deep impression on me. ----------------------------********************------------------------------------------------ If it were only possible to know this mystery It's like there's an entire universe she hid behind her eyes. She resembles a living figure of some ancient Greek goddess, Who just woke up and stepped her foot outside of the canvas of a large painting. Then she talks about love like she truly craves it. She wants to explore and probably can find you if you ever get lost. She does not fake how much she knows against all the things she doesn't, As she is not scared of the unknowns. There's many curtains she doesn't mind to open As she waits to see the butterflies on the other side. She appears vulnerable but brave And it's hard to define that mix. She smiles not so often, but when she does It's like an entire box of joy she unearths. She looks at you like she genuinely wants to know you. But there's also a waterfall of complex emotions she carries beneath her gaze. May be she doesn't know that she can calm the world with her stream That starts from that waterfall and ends into a wide river. And I'm sure that all lovers of her will love to swim in that river. But there will still remain a bound of how much you can know, Because there's no end to the depth behind those eyes, the space where she flies. Only you will need her to guide you.

Categories & Tags: Home, Life, Living, Moments, life, love, relationship conversation, You&amp;I
Content:
I: I want to talk to you. You: Why don't you? I: Because after all those, I feel scared of feeling in a certain way which drags me down everytime. You know how I can say many harsh things. You: Yes, you are ruthless. I: So, I also don't want to say something irrational again to shock you more. You: Good that you care. I: I know that we all have our own problems in our present and adding more to that and feeling stressed are probably we both can not afford. You: Then why do you complicate things time after time? I: Deep down, I still have deep emotion for you, and the many trauma I went through and risked myself with were and are pretty self destructive that I feel like I rather keep them in my safe box.  But still I am the one who ends up saying more on my own terms as I am probably always bad at listening. You: God, I wish you could listen more. I: Anyway, I miss you everytime anything resonates with me to realize how deeply I loved and cared about you, even though our expressions are very different. You: I miss you too. I: I was watching this movie "The mountain between us" - it's about these one male and female who get stuck after a plane crush and eventually survive. He was married and she was about to get married the next day after that plane crash. But they get closer while fighting for their survival. Eventually they came out of the situation falling in love with each other, but still when they came back to the real world from the wild, they could not just get together because they each had their past baggage to carry on, but eventually they get together again, because they truly had love for each other.. or may be the movie just wanted to produce a good ending. And may be, in real life, it's way more tragic. You: I understand. I: I truly see my love story, the way we met, the way we conquered many obstacles, the way I blindly trusted you and the way we demised as the greatest tragedy of my life, even if no one cares. You: May be you don't need to see everything so negatively. I: When I talked to my therapist who in a way saved me from wrecking myself, I described my state like a torn down island after a Tsunami, but I recognized that I have to rebuild again and I probably kind of did succeed in that, but definitely I did not feel at that moment that I will regain my courage to continue as I felt so little. You: But we need to learn from the past eventually. And I want to have you as a friend again. I: YEAH! I want to be your friend, I want to be in a place of strength where your thoughts and you no longer hurt me anymore, rather I can take you as one of the best friends who know certain parts of me more than anyone else. You: I'd love that. I miss talking to you too. I: I am pretty sure we are both quite different persons than who we were, may be in many ways unrecognizable. How do you truly feel about me when you think about me or us? Do you think you know me? You: There's many things that probably also didn't change though. But I also think I could revert many things and not hurt you. I: I know that I could not make you feel the way one wants to feel when one is in love and rather our love turned into boring chores and less exciting day by day and eventually it had to experience the death. You: I agree. I: May be, I took many things for granted that I shouldn't have and I have beaten myself for many years to find answers to what else I could have done. I have spent hours after hours feeling sad, and may be I still can not see the way you see and can move on just saying that it's the past we can learn from, because those hours of clouds and grief and depression will always have a reach at me. You: But you need to realize that it wasn't very easy for me either. I: It's me who felt betrayed, even if I didn't necessarily need to feel that way. You: What can I say more as I apologized many times for making things worse..? I: Yeah, I or we just can not change the past. I also wish I could revert many things, I also want to say sorry for saying many things that's not true, for doing many things that only pushed each other away, even though I also only intended otherwise, only wanted to bond more. We can only learn from the past, but I'm truly afraid whether I will ever be able to bring anyone as close as I brought you inside my heart. You: I know that. I: It just breaks my heart when I think about how our love expired. But there's definitely thousand things I have to be grateful for the experiences we had. And the things I learnt from our relationship. You: True. I: Like now, I'm lying down writing and thinking - We will just stay in two corners of the world knowing that we once loved each other. You: If you feel like, we can talk about our memories which are valuable to both of us. I: I even feel like if I could sit in front of you, I just won't have to say a single word. You: Yeah. I: That itself is meaningful. I truly think love is not easy to find and we were lucky to have it when we were young. You: I feel the same way. I: I hope I can find love again and I wish the same for you, because love is beautiful and worth living for. Thank you for the beautiful moments of your life that you shared with me. I truly wanted to have it more, but may be it was just not meant to be.

Some words just shine on you and reflect like zillions of lights altogether: "Presumably there is indeed no purpose in the ultimate fate of the cosmos, but do any of us really tie our life's hopes to the ultimate fate of the cosmos anyway? Of course we don't; not if we are sane. Our lives are ruled by all sorts of closer, warmer, human ambitions and perceptions. To accuse science of robbing life of the warmth that makes it worth living is so preposterously mistaken, so diametrically opposite.." - Excerpt from The Selfish Gene that Dawkins regret for not renaming as The Immortal Gene or The cooperative Gene. Whenever you have a shortage of purposefulness and your world become nihilistic, just call your loved ones. The ultimate reality of cosmos can never or should never take away your good feelings. #science #evolution #cosmos #nihilism #purpose #spiritual

Love to see people with similar background succeed like this. It's definitely encouraging and Pichai is definitely a roll model. We human beings love to follow, love to be desired, love to be cared for and also love to care. Evolutionarily it's drummed into us; human babies are the most vulnerable little things that take years to even navigate surrounding world, but when they do, they have the power to conquer the world, change the surrounding for themselves and for everybody around. We love to learn, and we learn first from parents, then people around us, then from people we look up to. Good parents and good mentors are the keys. Good roll models are what changed my life and I probably don't thank or acknowledge many people I met in my life (I think I appear rather pretty arrogant !), and learnt from but I do thank them in my heart and remember every ways I have been helped, and I feel grateful. During my days of distress, I learnt that the one virtue we should all master to keep our heart full is "Gratitude".. and when people say what did you learn from going to school for many many years and from life.. I simply say "Patience". But I admit, some days, I am not good at practicing them 😂! For those who don't know, who Sundar Pichai is (!!), he is the current CEO of Alphabet, for those who don't know what Alphabet Inc. is, Alphabet is the parent company of the mighty GOOGLE that you probably use at least once a day, don't you, I will be pretty surprised , if you say no lol 😂 (frankly amazed!!, please invite me to the cave you are living in)? So, that's the kind of influence Pichai has on internet 😢!! Well, keeping the conversation aside on Google being Evil or Good in this politically charged time, let's focus on individual success of such magnitude. https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2020/5888419/sundar-pichai/ success #rollmodel #times

I just rewatched couple times 🤭 It was so exhilarating and a powerful moment when Ahmed Elmahdi says to Gen: "You are the end of my dream and the start of my life." Amidst so much bad news in this COVID wrecked world, this definitely made me truly full of life and feel loved and hopeful about future. So happy to be a vital part of the beginning of this new, exciting bonding event at the wedding of Gen Judayna ElmahdiMy voice sounds so exotic.. lol.. when I make them kiss. But I feel so shy to see myself in the background though, the videographer was sneaky lol 🤭🤣 It was a wonderful wedding and one of those events that became a treasure in my memory lanes. Is my career of marriage officiator- starting from here?? LoL 🕺😆😅 @Friends, more wedding please!! And don't forget to invite me. I love a good wedding dance.

Over! Philly is in. Biden/Harris 2020. What a week, what a year! Probably some drama will continue.First female + Black/Colored/Mixed VP in USA. Happy Friday (Prediction: Biden 306 - 232 Trump) ---------------------------------------------------------------- Notes (Edits): I am not a complete fan of Biden or Harris. I just view them to be better or more positive force for the good the world needs. Biden/Harris and their neo-liberal policies do not necessarily mean a better future or solution to all problems Americans face and how America influences the world. There's about 70 million Americans who voted for Trump and I hope a good portion of them can still think for better and change!It should just be a beginning to many problems America and the world face: a) Climate Change b) Criminal Justice c) Education Reform d) HealthCare e) Housing f) Foreign Policy g) Money in politics etc. etc. But let's just celebrate. May be progress happens in small walks! #USElection2020#politics

I love a good movie. Who doesn't? I recently watched The Sound Of Metal. A story of a man named Ruben. Ruben and his girlfriend Lou were living in their RV and pursuing their passion for metal music in United States. Then suddenly life brings a big shock for Ruben. Ruben starts to lose his hearing. Doctors tell him that he will have to end being in noisy environment. That leads towards initial denial and bargaining stage of Ruben where he still wants to continue doing what he loves so much. But then when his anger turns into violent behavior, Lou leaves him and pushes him to go to a community of deaf people.  Ruben struggles but gradually starts to adapt and make friends. But Ruben still wants his old life back where the love of his life Lou is with him.  So, he ultimately violates the condition of his stay in the community and gets cochlear implants to gain back his ability to hear. But then he is told that as the community don't view disability as handicap - something to be changed or get away from or relieved, he can no longer stay with them. Ruben goes to France to meet Lou and again dreams to start touring as they used to. But from Lou's expression, he senses her doubt. And then he finally came to acceptance that his life has changed. They both changed when they separated. And Ruben leaves Lou, takes off his implant and accepts silence. This movie was profound to me as it shows Ruben's psychological stages of anger, denial, bargain, depression and acceptance. It also does a great job of portraying deaf person's joyful lives. I also talked about this movie here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6PktazZXb0&feature=youtu.be

So, it's true. "One man eating a bat collected from exotic Chinese market caused the Covid virus to rise and propagate which has now cost millions of death across the world. And we are still locked in this pandemic. Yes, one event can wipe the entire humanity if we collectively don't take actions." Nothing to blame on China, it could have happened in Philipines or Srilanka or anywhere. Let's stop or at least reduce eating animals. Aside from Covid, many health issues ranging from heart attack, high blood pressure, diabetes are connected with our meat consumption. There are several diseases well known to both the industry and the general public that are directly related to all the domestic meat species of beef, pork, lamb, and poultry. These include: a) E. coli from ground beef b) BSE (bovine spongiform encephalitis) from beef cattle c) Trichinosis from pork d) Salmonella from poultry e) Scrapie from lamb and muttonYou can read more: https://opentextbc.ca/.../diseases-associated-with-meat/Educate yourself about food and nutrition. I was an avid meat eater almost my entire life, because I did not know the facts and also I did not know about alternatives. I know that it's not easy to change our habit of eating meat so easy, if you are not willing to give up your meat eating, at least consider organic farm or grass fed sources or other humane place - but do consider transitioning towards less and less consumption of animal products. There's good plant based alternatives that you can learn in this Vegan documentary. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExOPTFRcR5I&feature=share And also learn about what veganism is about. Veganism is not about eating only, it's a movement against abuse and realization of the connection between environmental impact of factory farming etc. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa4butM2yZA #vegan I used to eat 3 eggs every morning for years. Now I haven't mostly touched eggs or any dairy products for 3 years. I know how much I used to love eggs and how much everyone likes their breakfast. But here, Dr. Eric will make you sad, but may be it will save many years of your sadness down the road due to high cholesterol consumption if you can consume at least less. If you read the comments you will see or you personally may have evidence like "Oh, my granddad has eaten 5 eggs a day until his death when he was like 95." Or, "oh my mom is so fit"Yes, you are right. You got good genetics. "I can find 5 smokers who lived till 80 years old" I also am a social smoker, but that does not mean I am gonna advise it for everyone. And also, I should quit smoking if I want to live longer and healthier. Public health advice are general science and evidence based advice to be followed, of course it will vary in the population. When a scientist or a doctor says that there's a higher risk, try to understand what that means. Higher risk means higher probability. If I drive faster than the speed limit, I have a higher risk of getting into an accident and die -> does not mean that I am gonna die for sure, coz I just drove 90 miles per hour yesterday because I was late in my meeting. When people talk about anti-scientific stuff to justify their understanding or deny the fact, I feel like banging my head on walls sometimes, but I know it's hard for irrational human mind to understand probability.We try to find examples to justify our behavior. And we do risky, dangerous addictive things like I struggle to stop smoking. But I do understand my chance of dying by speeding with my car is higher than my chance of dying from smoking, my chance of dying from smoking is higher than my chance of getting disease and dying from eating eggs. LoL.Anyway, understanding the risk and taking actions is ultimately necessary and sensible. I know we can't always do all the right things, that does not mean we should not have the intention to do so. Also just because I promote all the right things, does not also mean that I don't fail to do the right things either. We gotta do what we gotta do.

After at least 10 years of programming, I realize that I am definitely not an expert in any specific programming language. Instead, I always like to learn new concepts and dabble in new territories - that kind of matches my personality as an individual too. So, am I a polyglot then? Well, I feel nervous to say that... I do Golang in my current job, Javascript libraries at night for my interesting hobby projects, sometimes maintain geological software in Java and its website in PhP since grad school, Python in between lunch and dinner or leet code interview preps, Bash script whenever too much typing becomes boring. And then I recently can't help but think about learning rust especially as I am getting interested in the cryptocurrency Conflux and it's TreeGraph structure. And then I am not gonna even talk about all the functional programming languages that CS education tried to teach me.. well, I love the cryptocurrency Cardano which is written in Haskel functional lang that I sometimes try to take a peek at. But yeah, ask me any detailed questions about any of this language. I want to believe I have good foundational knowledge.. but I will most likely fail to answer and have to google the documentation or read Stackoverflow!!! I am terrible at Leetcode and tech interviews.. I love building and communicating with computers. So.. anyway, enjoyed reading another fellow programmer's perspective.https://deepu.tech/how-to-be-an-effective-polyglot-developer/ #programming #programminglanguage

My heart is heavy. Just looking at these pictures of father, mother, brother, sister, relatives crying - it really feels hopeless. I am sitting in this coffeeshop sipping my drinks sitting in a safe environment, but I can feel the terror of people running at this very moment. I feel this urge to do something. But really I can't do much except raising awareness. I really hope leaders and people in power can change their perspectives. We can't afford to lose more human lives and bring more human sufferings! Violence only begets violence. When you lose your loved ones, you feel like taking revenge. But revenge is never the answer. And it will always be imbalanced. Hate and revenge will only bring more hate and revenge - that's the only lesson that we need to learn from History. #freepalestine #finddiplomaticsolutions #diplomacy Source: https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/middleeast/israel-gaza-rafah-crossing-week-2-tuesday-intl-hnk

In the bustling French Quarter in New Orleans, I had an impromptu chess match with Jude Acers (@judeacers), "the man with the red beret." It was a game I didn't expect to do well in, but I managed to impress, especially in the last round where a bit more patience could have clinched victory. Jude recognized my effort, sharing puzzles and recommending a book to sharpen my skills. The journey to play him was an adventure in itself. I needed $5 cash to play and without any on hand, I scrambled—ATMs failed me, shops said no, and strangers couldn't help. It was over a delicious vegan crab poboy from MealsFromTheHeart that I found a way with my Venmo card. Returning to Jude with the money earned me a nod of respect for keeping my word. This experience was a clear reflection of my thirst for new adventures. I was due to leave New Orleans, but the urge to seize this unique opportunity was too strong, even if it meant getting back to Houston late. It's moments like these, stepping out of comfort for the sake of experience, that I truly live for. Yet, there's a pattern I'm confronting: getting so close to my goals and then somehow stepping back. It's funny how this mirrors my life: I chase new experiences but sometimes lose my nerve just as success is within reach. Recognizing this pattern, I hope to learn from it. It's a habit I'm learning to break, striving to be a more resilient version of myself. chess #reflection #life
